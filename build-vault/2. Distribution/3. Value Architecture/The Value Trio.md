Understanding that to produce a value architecture it requires the Trio.

The trio each has their own domain. Their domain is completely different in paradigm but interconnected with each other. Here the goal with value architecture, is to reinforce the interconnection, which then help each part of the "value" building. 

The idea of this separation through these domain is important cause fundamentally to build a robust value architecture requires these domain. The growth oversee the operation (getting customer, conversion, making money), the product oversee the vision (vision, quality, moats) and data helps bridging those two, inherently data sources for these domains will be scattered,


Teresa Torres famously vouch for the Product Trio (product manager, designer, software engineer), the trio for Value instead can be seen in as growth, product and data. 

Why there is extension here? The value architecture should be lead by growth. Growth scope can either inclined to data or analytics, design or marketing. The inclination of your growth person, will determine the extension. If your growth person is data oriented, most likely he need a designer companion, which then design would be the extension. However it is, the reason I want to maintain
