Nailing a niche first is likely the best growth strategy.

How do you do that?

1. Figure out your ICP. Who cares a lot about your solution?
2. Focus on solving specific problems. Solve that problem for ICPs better than others.
3. Refine your messaging. You convert customers if you offer what they want. Conveying your value prop in the best possible way is key.
4. Show your best proof.
5. Test and iterate. Continuously test your assumptions about the niche and be ready to pivot based on feedback and results.

Focus on one niche at a time. Once you gain a foothold, think about expanding.
