Great question.

  
Currently I'm working on few saas tools that helps my agency business, this is how I sustain my life as of now (building an agency) and (tools that help me build it).


Currently, I'm building this app called dealn.app, which an app that helps me close deal faster and scale up my deal/sales process. I have a pipeline of products that help my agency value chain, which then these tools can help other agency aswell.

  

To build more value for my agency I am building a backend system called Momentus. My target market for this is SaaS and mainly E-Commerce.

  

Where it's product stand in 4 hierarchy.

  

1. Momentus Activate (helps businesses instrument their tracking, event tracking strategy/planning, develop martech) it's a service work that helps client data activate.

  

2. Momentus Flow (is a data architecture) that I've build to help my client who already activate, do more with their data. This whole architecture consist of ELT, Complex Transformation, and multi output (can RAG for them to talk to their data, and create agents on top of it), attribution, cohort analysis, get full growth operating report, forecast sales etc.

  

3. Momentus Operate (is a reporting service) where I help clients create better roadmap to their success, this is based of data they have, which then I help them build their team, build their system, implement solutions, consultation etc.

  

4. Momentus Portal (is a reporting interface) for all their data, embedded with LLM (they use their own API)

  

This is a full fledge agency embedded deeply in tech, creating strategic positioning.

  

My goal is simple as of now, to have enough free cash flow to survive, scale and invest 20% to high leverage medium such as Digital Product, SaaS, E-commerce and PE.

  

The work I'm working on right now specifically is this, the Momentus Flow development require me to reverse engineer data use-cases/consumption, which requires me to understand data strategy.

  

This data strategy is the current specific interest of mine where I saw opportunity to develop a much systematic approach in developing metrics and strategy.

  

The approach begin by diagnosing the business model. There are three type of business stages, startup: fragile, stable business model: getting robust, ecosystem: achieve antifragile (think coca cola). (This align with Corporate Finance Life Cycle, and every other framework that also explain the same concept).

  

This systematic process is meant for known business model not startup due to it's nature of unknown working value chain and not yet business model fit. Strategy and analytics for this type of stages is pretty direct, PMF etc. (This also require modelling) but not our focus as of now.

  

For a robust business model, it make sense to turn them conceptually to quantitative.

  

This process begins with this flow

  

First, by mapping out their [[Business Model Assesment|business model components]].
  




Second, the business model component should be complete enough for us to understand basic foundation of the business is, how they make money, how they get customer, how they create value, value proposition, value distribution, value capture etc. This required to understand relationships between the business components, their drivers, their process, their internal components vs. their external components.

  

Third, I will then map out their value chain (from acquisition, closing/conversion, closed/onboarding, received value, post-service, complete full cycle of value chain) - Input to Output, Systems.

  

Fourth, this will provide a basic assumption of metrics needed to understand the health of the business operation and performance. Which then we create another metadata/metrics layer on top of it to create much control over the metrics, this related to metrics mapping/tree. It is essentially a causal model that allows members to anticipate results based on certain actions and, conversely, deduce actions from the results obtained. The model reduces uncertainty from strategic planning and decision-making and makes operational adjustments easier to perform and track. This helps data consumer to be data-informed.

  

Fifth, from this early metrics layer historical data, we can develop our foundation growth model, this model would help client/data consumer to achieve data-driven. This growth model equipped with expectation from forecasts (which here where organization able to forecast accurately shown great understanding of their operating model, able to forecast accurate = understand properly), with growth model and forecast, client can course correct, understand growth levers, minimize or remove things that is unnecessary, much bigger changes than just data-informed.

  

Here to provide more context, most metrics tree (data-informed) and growth model (data-driven) have certain patterns which can be transfer learn or reuse, this is why I want to create the momentus, we track these patterns and helps user (more client more proven pattern better result)

  

Sixth, metrics tree and growth model is enough to create a drive motion towards data, which helps, but essentially all business want to achieve antifragility. In vacuum or hindsight, the above steps help creating much much robusts business model, through trial and error which create progress/small payoff/wisdom etc, it helps business model to survive and be much robusts.

  

So in last step to ensure business model thrive and become better, there's few metrics (all business model patternly related) for an example, for moats, we can design metrics achieve moats.

  

for antifragility: **Antifragility/Success = (Convex Exposure to Randomness & Opportunity)** **+ (Rigorous Downside Capping via Via Negativa & Barbell Strategy)** **+ (Ensured Long-Term Survival via Ergodicity & Skin in the Game)**

  

We can design metrics to achieve such principle, for an example for a e-commerce to ensured long-term survival via ergodicity, Contribution Margin is a great metrics to measure right away, cause this would help eCommerce survive, but then only to survive. What about convex exposure, such as launching new product, launching new segment/market, new creatives for more ads etc. As you can see we can model principles like antifragile to quantitative.
