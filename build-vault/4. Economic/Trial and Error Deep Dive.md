Yes, in the context of antifragility, **trial and error** is indeed described as a mechanism that produces valuable **results**, which can encompass more than just what might conventionally be thought of as "wisdom." The sources indicate that these "results" are often in the form of **information, discoveries, innovations, and ultimately, enhanced survival and robustness**.

Here's a breakdown of what the sources identify as the "definite measure of output" from trial and error:

- **Information and Learning from Errors:**
    
    - Trial and error is inherently **antifragile** because it **benefits from errors, uncertainty, and disorder**.
    - When an entity is fragile, it "depends on things following the exact planned course," and deviations are harmful. However, for an antifragile entity, errors are not simply failures but a **source of valuable information**.
    - Every trial, especially when it goes wrong, provides information about "what does not work," allowing one to "start zooming in on a solution". This means that **each attempt becomes more valuable** because it reduces the space of the unknown. This is akin to finding a misplaced wallet; knowing where it _isn't_ helps you find where it _is_.
    - The random element in trial and error, when "carried out rationally," uses error as a source of information.
    - For a self-employed person, a small (non-terminal) mistake is "valuable information" that "directs him in his adaptive approach". This contrasts with a mistake for an employed person, which simply goes into a "permanent record".
- **Discoveries, Innovation, and Growth:**
    
    - The primary output of trial and error is **innovation and technological progress**. This is described as "antifragile tinkering, aggressive risk bearing rather than formal education".
    - Many breakthroughs, particularly in technology and medicine, are the result of **serendipity** and accidental discoveries arising from continuous exploration rather than planned, top-down research. The "excess energy released from overreaction to setbacks is what innovates!".
    - This process often involves "small errors" and "large potential payoff (unbounded)," leading to **explosive benefits** that are non-linear. The gains are "unbounded" or have an "unknown limit," while losses from errors are "limited and known".
    - The **"intelligence of antifragility"** allows individuals and systems to "do things without understanding them—and do them well". It provides a substitute for traditional "intelligence, knowledge, insight, skills" because "you don't have to be right that often". You only need "the wisdom to not do unintelligent things to hurt yourself" and to "recognize favorable outcomes when they occur".
- **Heuristics, Know-how, and Practical Wisdom:**
    
    - Trial and error, combined with optionality, leads to practical "know-how" (techne) that is distinct from theoretical "book knowledge" (episteme). This is about "doing" rather than just "thinking" or "talking".
    - This "wisdom in decision making is vastly more important—not just practically, but philosophically—than knowledge". Ancient wisdom, grandmothers' advice, and traditional heuristics are often presented as examples of knowledge filtered by time and derived from practical experience, which is inherently antifragile.
    - The sources highlight that "what is picked up in the classroom stays largely in the classroom" and that "traditional societies even those who fail—but have taken risks—have a higher status than those who are not exposed". This reinforces the value of real-world, error-driven learning.
- **Survival and Robustness:**
    
    - The ultimate "result" or "output" of effective trial and error is **survival**. Systems learn by filtering out what doesn't work and selecting "those less prone to a certain class of mistakes".
    - The "barbell strategy," which is a form of trial and error, allows one to "clip your downside, protect yourself from extreme harm, and let the upside, the positive Black Swans, take care of itself". This strategy transforms something from fragile to antifragile.
    - By making mistakes "numerous and small in harm," one can achieve antifragility. This allows systems to resist shocks and even "get better" when exposed to volatility.

In summary, the "results" or "output" from trial and error, in the context of antifragility, are not necessarily limited to a formal concept like "wisdom" but include all beneficial outcomes that arise from exposure to and learning from errors and disorder. These outcomes include **actionable information, new discoveries, innovations, and ultimately, enhanced resilience and the ability to thrive under uncertainty**, often in ways that cannot be predicted or fully understood beforehand. The process leverages the convexity of payoffs, where small, manageable losses lead to potentially unlimited gains.
