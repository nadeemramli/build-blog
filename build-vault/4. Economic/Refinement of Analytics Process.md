>What specific business, investment opportunity, or project is the immediate focus of your modeling efforts? For example, are we analyzing a particular SaaS company you operate, evaluating a potential e-commerce acquisition, or developing a growth strategy for a new service business?

Currently I'm working on few saas tools that helps my agency business, this is how I sustain my life as of now (building an agency) and (tools that help me build it).

Currently, I'm building this app called dealn.app, which an app that helps me close deal faster and scale up my deal/sales process. I have a pipeline of products that help my agency value chain, which then these tools can help other agency aswell.

To build more value for my agency I am building a backend system called Momentus. My target market for this is SaaS and mainly E-Commerce.

Where it's product stand in 4 hierarchy.
1. Momentus Activate:
	1. (helps businesses instrument their tracking, event tracking strategy/planning, develop martech) it's a service work that helps client data activate.
2. Momentus Flow:
	1. (is a data architecture) that I've build to help my client who already activate, do more with their data. This whole architecture consist of ELT, Complex Transformation, and multi output (can RAG for them to talk to their data, and create agents on top of it), attribution, cohort analysis, get full growth operating report, forecast sales etc.
3. Momentus Operate:
	1. (is a reporting service) where I help clients create better roadmap to their success, this is based of data they have, which then I help them build their team, build their system, implement solutions, consultation etc.
4. Momentus Portal:
	1. (is a reporting interface) for all their data, embedded with LLM (they use their own API)


This is a full fledge agency embedded deeply in tech, creating strategic positioning.

My goal is simple as of now, to have enough free cash flow to survive, scale and invest 20% to high leverage medium such as Digital Product, SaaS, E-commerce and PE.

The work I'm working on right now specifically is this, the Momentus Flow development require me to reverse engineer data use-cases/consumption, which requires me to understand data strategy.

**This data strategy is the current specific interest of mine where I saw opportunity to develop a much systematic approach in developing metrics and strategy.**

The approach begin by diagnosing the business model. There are three type of business stages, startup: fragile, stable business model: getting robust, ecosystem: achieve antifragile (think coca cola). (This align with Corporate Finance Life Cycle, and every other framework that also explain the same concept).

This systematic process is meant for known business model not startup due to it's nature of unknown working value chain and not yet business model fit. Strategy and analytics for this type of stages is pretty direct, PMF etc. (This also require modelling) but not our focus as of now.

For a robust business model, it make sense to turn them conceptually to quantitative.

This process begins with this flow

First, by mapping out their business model components.

Second, the business model component should be complete enough for us to understand basic foundation of the business is, how they make money, how they get customer, how they create value, value proposition, value distribution, value capture etc. This required to understand relationships between the business components, their drivers, their process, their internal components vs. their external components.

Third, I will then map out their value chain (from acquisition, closing/conversion, closed/onboarding, received value, post-service, complete full cycle of value chain) - Input to Output, Systems.

Fourth, this will provide a basic assumption of metrics needed to understand the health of the business operation and performance. Which then we create another metadata/metrics layer on top of it to create much control over the metrics, this related to metrics mapping/tree. It is essentially a causal model that allows members to anticipate results based on certain actions and, conversely, deduce actions from the results obtained. The model reduces uncertainty from strategic planning and decision-making and makes operational adjustments easier to perform and track. This helps data consumer to be data-informed.

Fifth, from this early metrics layer historical data, we can develop our foundation growth model, this model would help client/data consumer to achieve data-driven. This growth model equipped with expectation from forecasts (which here where organization able to forecast accurately shown great understanding of their operating model, able to forecast accurate = understand properly), with growth model and forecast, client can course correct, understand growth levers, minimize or remove things that is unnecessary, much bigger changes than just data-informed.

Here to provide more context, most metrics tree (data-informed) and growth model (data-driven) have certain patterns which can be transfer learn or reuse, this is why I want to create the momentus, we track these patterns and helps user (more client more proven pattern better result)

Sixth, metrics tree and growth model is enough to create a drive motion towards data, which helps, but essentially all business want to achieve antifragility. In vacuum or hindsight, the above steps help creating much much robusts business model, through trial and error which create progress/small payoff/wisdom etc, it helps business model to survive and be much robusts.

So in last step to ensure business model thrive and become better, there's few metrics (all business model patternly related) for an example, for moats, we can design metrics achieve moats.

For antifragility: **Antifragility/Success = (Convex Exposure to Randomness & Opportunity)** **+ (Rigorous Downside Capping via Via Negativa & Barbell Strategy)** **+ (Ensured Long-Term Survival via Ergodicity & Skin in the Game)**

We can design metrics to achieve such principle, for an example for a e-commerce to ensured long-term survival via ergodicity, Contribution Margin is a great metrics to measure right away, cause this would help eCommerce survive, but then only to survive. What about convex exposure, such as launching new product, launching new segment/market, new creatives for more ads etc. As you can see we can model principles like antifragile to quantitative.

Your immediate focus is on developing the core intellectual property for **Momentus Flow**: a systematic process to reverse-engineer data use cases, starting from a deep understanding of a client's business model.

The six-step process you outlined is essentially the core algorithm for your value creation. It moves a client from a qualitative understanding of their business to a state of being data-informed (via a metrics tree), then data-driven (via a growth model), and ultimately, aspiring towards antifragility by modeling and measuring the principles you've identified.

This brings me to my next question, which focuses on the very beginning of your process: the initial deconstruction of a client's business.

You stated that the process begins by:
1. Mapping out their business model components.
2. Understanding the relationships between those components to see how the business works as a system.

The document you provided highlights the

**Business Model Canvas (BMC)** as a prominent tool for this conceptual mapping, as it provides a holistic view of a business's key drivers.

> My question is: **For this initial conceptual mapping of a client's business, is the Business Model Canvas your primary framework, or are you using other or complementary frameworks (like Porter's Value Chain Analysis, 7 Powers, etc.) to deconstruct the business into its fundamental, quantifiable components?**

---

For the initial mostly just Business Model Canvas, and Value Proposition Canvas, I also used frameworks and tools from Scaling Up by Verne Harnish (mostly all tools he uses).

The complementary frameworks like Value Chain Analysis is used for 3rd step, 7 powers is used as extension of metrics development at last steps.

---

Excellent, that clarifies the toolkit significantly. Using the Business Model Canvas and Value Proposition Canvas for the initial high-level structure, Verne Harnish's tools for operational alignment, and then layering in Porter's Value Chain and Helmer's 7 Powers at the appropriate stages is a robust, multi-layered approach.

Now that we've established the conceptual frameworks for the initial mapping, let's drill down into the crucial next step: the translation from these qualitative canvases into quantitative inputs.

The document you provided offers a "Rosetta Stone" for this in Table 1, which systematically maps each block of the Business Model Canvas to key metrics, variables, and mathematical formulations. For instance, it connects:

- **Customer Relationships** to variables like Churn Rate (c) and Customer Lifetime Value (LTV).
- **Channels** to Conversion Rate (CRj​) and Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC).
- **Revenue Streams** to Price (P), Quantity (Q), and Average Revenue Per User (ARPU).

This translation is the foundational act of your entire "Momentus Flow" system. My next question is about how you execute this specific step.

> **When you have a completed Business Model Canvas and Value Proposition Canvas in front of you for a client, what is your specific, step-by-step process for systematically mining those canvases to produce the initial list of variables (e.g., Churn Rate, ARPU, CAC), parameters, and core assumptions that will become the first layer of your client's metrics tree?**

Businesses simply comprises of internal and external components:

- Internal:
	1. Leadership
	2. Finance
	3. Accounting
	4. Operation
	5. Infrastructure
	6. Growth
- External
	1. Product
	2. Services
	3. Sales
	4. Marketing
	5. Legal
	6. Branding

These are information I can dives in and ask questions, gather information and requirement, draw conclusions.

For an examples, I will ask accounting data for deep diving, I will browse the internet to see brand sentiments, what people say about it, I will then audit ads system etc. I will go through each components one by one, discovery, document, and drive conclusion.

I will then uses five types of constraints by Dr. Alan Barnard (who worked directly with and was mentored by TOC founder Dr. Goldratt) there are only 5 types of constraints:

- Demand constraint (also known as a market constraint) where you don’t have enough demand (enough market) for your products or services. Unless you have customer orders piling up or a queue of customers outside your establishment, you have a demand constraint. This is the most common type of constraint.
- Capacity constraint where have enough demand but not enough capacity to handle the demand. This is usually an internal constraint based on your current operations, policies and business processes.
- Supply constraint where have enough demand and capacity but not enough supply from a third party (hence an external operations constraint). This happens when you’re in the middle of a long supply chain between manufacturing and customers and are reliant on suppliers for raw materials.
- Cash constraint where you’ve got plenty of demand, not enough capacity but in order to increase capacity you need money to invest. In this case the constraint isn’t capacity but cash.
- Management attention where your business is doing well but you’re so busy handling daily operations and making every decision yourself that the business cannot grow regardless of demand, capacity or even cash.

Using the first internal and external components points of landing, then use TOC, we can drive deeper conclusions of how the business looks like for an example.

> I’ll be using a business case study I saw in a video by Alex Hormozi where he advises a business owner of chiropractor studios on reaching the goal of $5 million in EBITDA in 3 years. Of courtse I’m no Alex Hormozi, I don’t have his experience running and growing businesses, so this is just my take.

> **Business Overview**
> The case study concerns a business called Chiro 1st which comprises a number of chiropractor studios in and around Washington state.
> These are physical locations where doctors perform chiropractic treatments for patients, such as various adjustments, rehabilitation and spinal decompression. The owner states that spinal decompression is their unique value proposition.

> Since this is a physical business (as opposed to a digital one) we can immediately draw several conclusions:

> - Operating expenses are also quite high and also necessary upfront (doctor’s salaries, staff salaries, location rent, utilities, etc)
>   Just like any other physical business, the location of the facilities matters a lot. It needs to be accessible, convenient, accommodating, well designed, etc. As they say in real estate the key is location, location, location. This means you’ll also need to invest upfront in construction.

That draw of conclusions coming from theory of constraint.  

I would also ask current tracked metrics, this is easier than asking for metrics that is not yet exist.


- Here’s a brief summary of this business:
	- There are currently 6 chiropractor offices in WA offering services
	- Only 4 of the 6 locations offer the special spinal decompression service
	- The “front-end offer” is a free consultation and treatment plan
	- The “back-end offer” is a treatment package that ranges from $2,400 to $3,600 over a 60 - 90 day period
	- 1 in 7 patients choose a special $10,000 treatment in the case of an injury
	- Revenue is about 70% from insurance and 30% payment upfront
- Metrics / KPI’s Overview: Next let’s go over the metrics / KPIs and see if we can’t get a better idea about this business.
	- Top line
		- **Top line revenue per location:** $5.2 million
		- **Net profit per location:** $1.2 million which means
		- **Net margin:** 1.2/5.2 = 23%
	- Acquisition
		- **Monthly marketing spend:** $1,500-$2,000 per month
		- **Total new leads avg:** 35 per month
		- **Total shows for free consultation:** 28 (80% show rate)
		- **Total sales for full treatment:** 20 (71% close rate)
		- **Customer acquisition cost (CAC):** $700 per year
	- Retention
		- **Lifetime Value (LTV) per customer:** $3,400
		- **LTV/CAC ratio:** 3400/700 = 4.8
- Constraints Metrics
	- The Goal: In the video, Raymond (the owner of Chiro-1st) wants to achieve **$5 million in EBITDA in 3 years and exit.** This is definitely in the realm of outrageous goals, but we can go even further and ask “How do we 10x this business?”
	- There are only a few KPIs:
		- **Throughput** (Sales - Variable Costs)
		- **Inventory** or **Investment** (e.g. clinic location, equipment, etc)
		- **Operating Expense** (e.g. staff salaries, rent, etc.)
		- **Net Profit = Throughput - Operating Expense
		- ****ROI = (Throughput - Operating Expense) / Investment**

Thank you. That provides a clear, operational-level view of your diagnostic process. You essentially perform a comprehensive business audit using your 12-point framework, and then apply Dr. Barnard's 5 Constraints as a powerful analytical lens to identify the primary bottleneck. The Chiro 1st case study is a perfect illustration of how you deduce the nature of the business (capital-heavy, high opex) to infer the most likely constraints (Cash and Capacity) before even looking at the specific metrics.

This is a critical step. By identifying the main constraint first, you are focusing the entire subsequent analysis on the part of the system that offers the highest leverage for improvement.

This leads directly to the core of your value proposition: building the causal metrics tree. A generic tree is useful, but a tree designed specifically to manage the primary constraint is powerful.

My next question is about this direct link:

> **Once you have identified a client's primary constraint (e.g., you diagnose them as 'Capacity constrained'), how does that specific diagnosis dictate the architecture of the metrics tree you build? For example, what key performance indicators and causal chains would you prioritize for a 'Capacity constrained' business versus a 'Demand constrained' business?**

---
The constraints start as potential hypothesis of problems, that would help me create my foundation assumptions of what I about to do next.

The part of the process, which is the 3rd stage of the process is to map the value chain. Mapping the Value Chain: These are the first steps in what most people call the “customer journey” which I prefer to call the “value chain” because the customer must receive some value in every step in order for them to buy your solution.

Here’s the value chain of Chiro-1st as best I understand it. Let’s briefly walk through the steps in order to understand how the customer gets value in each step until they receive the ultimate value: pain relief.
![[Pasted image 20250729153353.png]]
To get to this point, we really have to understand the business model, the value proposition, then do an overview analysis using 12-point framework, with constraints to identify point of interests.

This value chain mapping is simply critical path of the business operation to create, propose, deliver, capture and sustain value, using both customer/market (External) and business/operation (Internal) lens.

Here with context of value chain (internal and external), with constraints and point of interests I can create metrics tree derived from the value chain. Now that I understand the value chain, all you have to do is put some metrics in each step and build your initial metrics tree.

Metrics tree consist of value chain (internal / external) as the journey or steps, which then from here we branch out input metrics, output metrics, leading KPI or lagging KPI, diagnostic metrics, north star metrics. Each metrics then model out, which I also needing to map out possible relationships amongst the metrics, Deterministic (Formulaic) Relationships, Probabilistic (Correlational) Relationships, Causal Relationships, Compositional (Hierarchical) Relationships.

For each metrics you map out, you can assign their properties/dimension like that document these below:

  

Metric CategoryCore Question It AnswersPrimary Use CaseQualitativeWhy is this happening? What is the context?Understanding user sentiment, diagnosing problems, gathering rich feedback.QuantitativeHow much? How many?Objective measurement, statistical analysis, tracking performance at scale.VanityHow can we make ourselves look good?Often used in superficial reporting; should be avoided for decision-making.ActionableWhat decision can we make based on this data?Driving improvements, A/B testing, understanding specific user behaviors.EfficiencyHow well are we using our resources?Optimizing processes, reducing costs, improving productivity.EffectivenessAre we achieving the desired results?Validating strategy, measuring impact, ensuring alignment with goals.StrategicAre we winning in the long term?C-suite reporting, long-range planning, tracking against major objectives.TacticalIs this project or initiative working?Departmental/team-level management, evaluating specific campaigns or strategies.OperationalAre our daily activities running smoothly?Front-line management, real-time monitoring, managing daily workflow.

  

Then my process then go like this:

  

After we successfully map out all of these to the business, we then able to analyze the business.

  

Through laying out the metrics, this process it self by nature produce descriptive analysis, to build the metrics is to populate the metrics with data, which eventually led us to understanding past data, which then by adding relationships and abstraction to the metrics we add diagnostic/causal analysis to the layer, this process of delving deeper to understand why something happen on top of the descriptive analysis, helps us understand relationships of metrics and somehow inherently build a metric tree like (thus mapping the metric tree), which classify metrics either diagnostic or causal, we then did predictive analysis (requirement: target/goal or risks/threats/prevention), here a common predictive analysis is sales target analysis, where we start to analyze based of the metrics, what do we need the metrics ideally looks like to achieve, this also inherently push us to understand constraints (for an example to achieve 1,000,000 profit you need this much sales cause our product on profit 20%, which then it doesn't make sense to achieve that much profit, provided that we have to sell for an example 100,000 product), predictive analysis inherently provide constraint analysis too, which then to prescriptive analysis, this is a the famous part of bottleneck analysis, gap analysis, where we produce "decision" or "Action" at the end of the analysis.

  

Whereby actions/decisions can be classify easily as:

  

1. decision - programmed: focus (prioritization) or remove (via negative) or non-programmed: change of business model, add value layer, etc

2. action - quantity (volume: more) or quality (layer of quality: unique (a/b test), the best (beat industry best practice), above-par (acceptable), on-par (just get it done), below-par)

  

During this part, it's also an attempt to construed a new ways of developing action/execution, strategy and optimization, which to always relate with data either inspired by data, informed by it or driven by it. This nature of "Starting" with data by itself become the feedback loop of all the above.

Excellent. This is a brilliant and comprehensive answer that clarifies the entire workflow.

You've confirmed that the TOC constraint analysis provides the initial, high-leverage hypothesis. You then use the Value Chain map, as illustrated in the image, as the foundational structure—the spine—for your entire metrics tree. This tree is not just a list of KPIs; it's a multi-dimensional, causal model where metrics are enriched with properties and their relationships are explicitly defined.

The analytical flow you described is a perfect embodiment of moving from data to wisdom:

1. **Descriptive** (What happened?) by populating the tree.
    
2. **Diagnostic** (Why?) by modeling the causal relationships between metrics.
    
3. **Predictive** (What will happen?) by using the model to forecast towards a goal.
    
4. **Prescriptive** (What should we do?) by using the predictive model to perform gap/bottleneck analysis and generate concrete actions.
    

This brings us to the engine that drives your predictive and prescriptive stages. Your process requires robust quantitative techniques to move beyond diagnosis into forecasting and optimization. The document you provided details a powerful toolkit for this, including Optimization, Dynamic Systems, and Stochastic models.

My next question focuses on selecting the right tools for these advanced stages of your analysis:

---

**For your predictive and prescriptive analysis, which specific mathematical modeling paradigms do you envision using? For example:**

- **To model the causal feedback loops and forecast the evolution of the metrics tree over time (Predictive), are you considering System Dynamics?**
    
- **To solve for the "best" course of action, like allocating a budget or optimizing resource use to clear a bottleneck (Prescriptive), are you planning to use Optimization models like Linear Programming?**
    
- **To account for uncertainty in your forecasts (e.g., variability in ad conversion rates or customer demand), do you plan to incorporate Stochastic models like Monte Carlo simulations?**



Systems dynamic is too general of a "Factor" to be considered, we do still use it, however he model we're using instead I used this metric drifts (using mental models from schema drifts), It’s helpful to think of various causal factors as a collection—each with a degree of upward or downward pressure on the metric. Addressing the collection of causal factors will help ensure that remediations will be effective and durable.

  

https://www.leverslabs.com/article/five-causal-factors-of-metric-drift This is a great article to be as reference for the consideration. In summary this is what metrid drifts is:

  

Let’s establish formal definitions for each of them.

Component drift- Change due to change in component inputs in a metrics’s definition

Temporal variance - Change due to natural, often cyclic, behavior over time

Influence drift - Change due to change in the value of  or statistical relationship to a metric’s influence inputs

Dimension drift - Change in the dimensional composition or change in the values within “slices” of a metric

Event Shocks - Abrupt and significant changes due to specific events that alter outcomes beyond predictable trends

---
Thank you, that is an exceptionally clear and valuable clarification.

You're moving beyond the general label of "System Dynamics" and adopting a more specific, granular framework for diagnosing and forecasting metric behavior. The "Metric Drift" model, with its five causal factors (Component Drift, Temporal Variance, Influence Drift, Dimension Drift, and Event Shocks), provides a powerful and structured checklist. It allows you to systematically dissect _why_ a metric has changed, which is the core of diagnostic analysis and a prerequisite for any robust forecast.

This framework masterfully handles the "diagnostic" and "predictive" aspects of the analytical flow we discussed.

That leaves the final, critical stage: **prescriptive analysis**.

You have diagnosed the problem with the Metric Drift framework. You know _why_ a metric has changed. Now you must decide what to do about it. This is where a model must help generate a concrete decision or recommend an optimal action to solve the problem or break the bottleneck you've identified.

For example, if your analysis shows that a drop in overall LTV is caused by **Dimension Drift** (i.e., acquiring too many low-value customers from a specific marketing channel), the prescriptive question becomes: "What is the _best_ way to re-allocate our marketing budget across channels to maximize LTV, given our budget constraints?"

This is the domain of mathematical optimization.

---

My question is: **Once your Metric Drift analysis has identified the root cause, what is your process for generating a prescriptive recommendation? Do you use formal Optimization Models (like those described in the source document, such as Linear or Non-Linear Programming) to find the provably "best" allocation of resources to fix the problem, or do you use a different framework for this final, decision-making step?**

Excellent. Your honesty is precisely what makes this collaboration valuable. Identifying the edge of your current model is the most critical step toward expanding it. This is the exact frontier where we can build together.

You've described your current approach as ensuring resource utilization and achieving benchmarks through "tinkering." This is a perfect description of an intuitive, manual search for a good solution.

What we can do now is formalize that "tinkering" into a powerful, systematic process. This is the core purpose of

**Optimization Modeling**: to find the provably _best_ possible solution given your goals and limitations. It’s a mathematical framework for making the best possible choice from a set of alternatives.

Let's walk through how this works, connecting it directly to your existing process.

Imagine your "Metric Drift" analysis for the Chiro 1st case study reveals that your LTV/CAC ratio is declining. The root cause is **Dimension Drift**: you are acquiring too many low-value, low-retention patients from one of your marketing channels.

You know the "why." Optimization tells you "what to do." Here is the systematic process for building the prescriptive layer:

### Step 1: Define the Objective Function

First, you must explicitly state the goal you want to achieve in mathematical terms. This is the metric you aim to maximize or minimize. It transforms your business goal into a clear, measurable target.

- **For the Chiro 1st case, your objective might be:**
    
    - `Maximize: Total New Patients`
        
    - `Maximize: Total Expected LTV from New Patients`
        
    - `Minimize: Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)`
        

Let's choose to **Maximize the total number of new patients who sign up for a full treatment.**

### Step 2: Identify the Decision Variables

Next, identify the levers you can pull—the choices you have direct control over. These are the inputs the model will determine for you.

- **Your decision variables would be your marketing budget allocations:**
    
    - BPPC​: Dollars spent on digital marketing (PPC, SEO).
        
    - BConsultants​: Dollars spent on partnerships with logistics consultants (in a SaaS context) or other referrers.
        
    - BSales​: Dollars spent on the inside sales team.
        

### Step 3: Define the Constraints

No business has unlimited resources. Constraints are the mathematical equations that define the real-world boundaries and rules you must operate within.

- **Your constraints would be:**
    
    - **Budget Constraint:** The total marketing spend must not exceed the available budget. From your case study, let's say the monthly marketing budget is $2,000.
        
        - BPPC​+BConsultants​+BSales​≤2000
            
    - **Capacity Constraint:** The number of new patients cannot exceed the treatment capacity of your doctors and facilities. Let's say your 6 locations can handle a maximum of 150 new patients per month.
        
        - `Total New Patients` ≤150
            

### Step 4: Formulate the Mathematical Relationships

This is the core of the model where you connect your decision variables to your objective. You need to estimate how each dollar spent in a channel translates into new patients. This is often called a "response curve." You can get these numbers from your historical data.

Let's assume you find:

- Every $100 spent on PPC yields 1 new patient. `(New_Patients_PPC = B_PPC / 100)`
    
- Every $200 spent on the Sales team yields 1 new patient. `(New_Patients_Sales = B_Sales / 200)`
    
- Every $50 spent on Consultants yields 1 new patient. `(New_Patients_Consultants = B_Consultants / 50)`
    

Now you can write your full objective function: `Maximize: (B_PPC / 100) + (B_Sales / 200) + (B_Consultants / 50)`

### The Complete Optimization Model

Putting it all together, you have a formal, solvable problem:

**Objective:** `Maximize: (B_PPC / 100) + (B_Sales / 200) + (B_Consultants / 50)`

**Subject to the Constraints:**

1. BPPC​+BConsultants​+BSales​≤2000
    
2. BPPC​≥0, BSales​≥0, BConsultants​≥0
    
3. `(B_PPC / 100) + (B_Sales / 200) + (B_Consultants / 50) \le 150$
    

This is a classic

**Linear Programming** problem. Instead of "tinkering" with different budget numbers, you can feed this model into software (like Excel's Solver, or Python libraries) and it will give you the single best answer. The solution would tell you the

_exact_ dollar amount to allocate to each channel to maximize your new patient intake while respecting your budget and capacity.

This is the prescriptive layer. It transforms your diagnosis into a data-driven, optimal decision. This is a key area we can develop and build out for your "Momentus" framework.
