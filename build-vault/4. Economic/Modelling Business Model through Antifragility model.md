Great, let's do this. 

In a form of business model (the medium of taking risk) - this can be define as trading or working/career, or solopreneur. 
That business model would have properties which we can turn it into variables for the equation. 

For an example 



First let's understand what is a business model?



Second, let's map out business model to business architecture


Understand business architecture etc


Now let's translate the these two conceptual models from it's components, relationships, function to equations, variables and constraint, so we can simulate, optimize and analyze the model in quantitative way.
