Each step has it's own process/method and output. However the output is not limited to just continue the next step, instead each output has it's own information which can be use for both improving business documentation, operation and analytics. For an example, to even begin the first step, it's required to assess the business accounts, having access to such data is imperative to understand the business stage. During this phase, you already have the tendency to figure out what's wrong with the business (financially mostly), but you can't be impulsive here, in my experience this tendency to assume solutions/problems this fast will result to pre-mature decision and "bad" relationship with the clientele (cause most of the time the diagnosis is "Obvious"). But as you can see, even the first step is enough to produce progress, and information to help the business.

The third step specifically have two branch to move forward, one to continue the systematic process, two to map out operation plan. Here you can start fill in people, strategy, execution and cash documents from the growth tools. Still however, I think it's too early to map out the scaling plan for the business, instead we can just draft it, which help us to move forward.


The systematic six-step process begin by diagnosing the business to understand where it belong in the stages of business lifecycle. 

First, by mapping out their business model components.

Second, the business model component should be complete enough for us to understand basic foundation of the business is, how they make money, how they get customer, how they create value, value proposition, value distribution, value capture etc. This required to understand relationships between the business components, their drivers, their process, their internal components vs. their external components.

Third, I will then map out their value chain (from acquisition, closing/conversion, closed/onboarding, received value, post-service, complete full cycle of value chain) - Input to Output, Systems.

Fourth, this will provide a basic assumption of metrics needed to understand the health of the business operation and performance. Which then we create another metadata/metrics layer on top of it to create much control over the metrics, this related to metrics mapping/tree. It is essentially a causal model that allows members to anticipate results based on certain actions and, conversely, deduce actions from the results obtained. The model reduces uncertainty from strategic planning and decision-making and makes operational adjustments easier to perform and track. This helps data consumer to be data-informed.

Fifth, from this early metrics layer historical data, we can develop our foundation growth model, this model would help client/data consumer to achieve data-driven. This growth model equipped with expectation from forecasts (which here where organization able to forecast accurately shown great understanding of their operating model, able to forecast accurate = understand properly), with growth model and forecast, client can course correct, understand growth levers, minimize or remove things that is unnecessary, much bigger changes than just data-informed.

Here to provide more context, most metrics tree (data-informed) and growth model (data-driven) have certain patterns which can be transfer learn or reuse, this is why I want to create the momentus, we track these patterns and helps user (more client more proven pattern better result)

Sixth, metrics tree and growth model is enough to create a drive motion towards data, which helps, but essentially all business want to achieve antifragility. In vacuum or hindsight, the above steps help creating much much robusts business model, through trial and error which create progress/small payoff/wisdom etc, it helps business model to survive and be much robusts.

So in last step to ensure business model thrive and become better, there's few metrics (all business model patternly related) for an example, for moats, we can design metrics achieve moats.

For antifragility: **Antifragility/Success = (Convex Exposure to Randomness & Opportunity)** **+ (Rigorous Downside Capping via Via Negativa & Barbell Strategy)** **+ (Ensured Long-Term Survival via Ergodicity & Skin in the Game)**

We can design metrics to achieve such principle, for an example for a e-commerce to ensured long-term survival via ergodicity, Contribution Margin is a great metrics to measure right away, cause this would help eCommerce survive, but then only to survive. What about convex exposure, such as launching new product, launching new segment/market, new creatives for more ads etc. As you can see we can model principles like antifragile to quantitative.


**A Revised Framework Following Your Stated Process:**

**Step 1: Mapping Business Model Components**

- This is the entry point. The process begins with foundational, high-level conceptual mapping.
    
- **Primary Tools:** Business Model Canvas, Value Proposition Canvas.
    

**Step 2: Understanding Component Relationships**

- This step goes deeper into the "how" and "why" of the business model mapped in Step 1.
    
- **Discovery Tool:** The 12-point internal/external component checklist is used here to guide a comprehensive data-gathering audit.
    
- **Analytical Lens:** The Theory of Constraints (TOC) is applied at this stage to analyze the relationships discovered and to form a **"potential hypothesis"** about the system's primary bottleneck.
    

**Step 3: Mapping the Value Chain**

- This step is unchanged and remains the critical path for understanding value delivery.
    
- It traces the journey from acquisition to post-service and forms the backbone of the subsequent metrics architecture.
    

**Step 4: Developing the Foundational Metrics Tree (Becoming "Data-Informed")**

- This stage focuses on building the causal model of metrics.
    
- **Architecture:** The value chain acts as the spine, with branches for different metric types and properties (as we detailed).
    
- **Diagnostic Engine:** The **Metric Drift Framework** (Component, Temporal, Influence, etc.) is the specific tool used here to understand the causal relationships and diagnose _why_ metrics change.
    

**Step 5: Building the Foundation Growth Model (Becoming "Data-Driven")**

- This step uses the historical data and causal relationships from the metrics tree to build a predictive model.
    
- **Purpose:** To create forecasts, understand growth levers, and enable course correction.
    
- **Prescriptive Engine:** **Optimization Modeling** (Linear Programming, etc.) fits here as the tool to solve for the "best" course of actionâ€”how to allocate resources to act on the growth levers and close performance gaps identified by the model.
    

**Step 6: Modeling for Antifragility (Ensuring the Business Thrives)**

- This is the final and ultimate goal of the entire process, moving beyond robustness to antifragility.
    
- This involves designing specific, high-level metrics that directly track progress against core principles.
    
- **Guiding Formula:** As you stated, `Antifragility/Success = (Convex Exposure to Randomness & Opportunity) + (Rigorous Downside Capping via Via Negativa & Barbell Strategy) + (Ensured Long-Term Survival via Ergodicity & Skin in the Game)`.
    
- **Example Metrics:** Designing a "Contribution Margin" metric to track survival, or an "Experimentation Velocity" metric to track convex exposure.


What documents they produce?
step 1: bmc profile
step 2

step 4: metrics tree - which then goes to question of adoption and usages, goes back to optimization and how organization use data
