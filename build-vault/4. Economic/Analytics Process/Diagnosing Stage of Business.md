Before we start doing any fact finding and begin our six-step process, we first need to understand the business stages. We first need to diagnose the business model and accurately understand their business stages. This acts as a qualification gate to ensure the right analytical approach is applied to the right type of company.

There are three type of business stages: (This align with Corporate Finance Life Cycle, and every other framework that also explain the same concept).
1. **Startup (Fragile):** 
	1. Characterized by an unknown value chain and a search for Product-Market Fit. This stage requires a different type of modeling and is explicitly **not** the target for the systematic process we are defining.
2. **Stable Business Model (Robust):** 
	1. This is the ideal candidate for the systematic six-step process. These are businesses where it **"make[s] sense to turn them conceptually to quantitative."***
3. **Ecosystem (Antifragile):** 
	1. This is the aspirational state, which the final step of the process is designed to help a business achieve.
