### **Understanding Component Relationships**

This step goes deeper into the "how" and "why" of the business model mapped in Step 1. The process begins with a comprehensive discovery phase to understand the business as a complete system and to form a high-leverage hypothesis about its primary operational constraint.

- **Discovery Framework/Tool:** The 12-point internal/external component checklist is used here to guide a comprehensive data-gathering audit, match with RACI and Maturity dimensions.
- **Analytical Lens:** The Theory of Constraints (TOC) is applied at this stage to analyze the relationships discovered and to form a **"potential hypothesis"** about the system's primary bottleneck.

#### **Section 1.1: The Discovery Framework/Tool**

A full business audit is conducted by gathering information across a 12-point checklist, ensuring a holistic view of the organization.

- **Internal Components:**
    - Leadership: Leadership is a critical human resource (asset) and strategic management is a key activity that governs the entire canvas.
    - Finance: The finance function manages the economic engine of the business—the inflow of revenue and the outflow of costs.
    - Accounting: Accounting is a fundamental activity required to operate and understand the business's cost structure and overall financial health.
    - Operation: Operations are the core, day-to-day activities the business must perform to create and deliver its value proposition.
    - Infrastructure: Infrastructure (tech stack, physical locations, etc.) represents the essential assets needed for the business model to function.
    - Growth: Growth isn't a single block but an outcome of the entire model, driven by the interplay of all customer-facing and internal components.
- **External Components:** 
	- Product: The product (or service) is the core bundle of value that you offer to your customers.
	- Services: As you noted, services build customer relationships. They can also be a core part of the value proposition itself.
	- Sales: The sales function is a key activity that directly generates the company's revenue streams.
	- Marketing: Marketing defines the channels you use to reach customers and is a key activity for building customer relationships.
	- Legal: Legal work is a key supporting activity. Intellectual property (patents, trademarks) managed by legal are key resources.
	- Branding: The brand is a key resource (asset) that shapes how customers perceive your value proposition and builds trust.

A complete table of the Discovery Framework seems like this: This required to understand relationships between the business components, their drivers, their process, their internal components vs. their external components. If Business Model Canvas help you map out the business, Discovery Framework helps you understand it.

This audit involves deep dives into specific areas, such as analyzing accounting data, auditing advertising systems, and assessing public brand sentiment. There's also more writing regarding this matter at [[Understanding Scope of Optimization]], specifically talking how optimization is different for each components based of their inherent properties.

#### **Section 1.2: The Primary Analytical Lens - Theory of Constraints (TOC)**
The information gathered is analyzed through the lens of the Theory of Constraints to identify the system's primary bottleneck. This is guided by the five constraint types identified by Dr. Alan Barnard:

1. **Demand Constraint:** (also known as a market constraint) where you don’t have enough demand (enough market) for your products or services. 
	1. Unless you have customer orders piling up or a queue of customers outside your establishment, you have a demand constraint. This is the most common type of constraint.
	2. The market has insufficient demand for the products or services.
2. **Capacity Constraint:** where have enough demand but not enough capacity to handle the demand. This is usually an internal constraint based on your current operations, policies and business processes.
	1. Demand exists, but the internal capacity is insufficient to meet it.
3. **Supply Constraint:** where have enough demand and capacity but not enough supply from a third party (hence an external operations constraint). 
	1. This happens when you’re in the middle of a long supply chain between manufacturing and customers and are reliant on suppliers for raw materials.
	2. Demand and capacity exist, but there is not enough supply from third parties.
4. **Cash Constraint:** where you’ve got plenty of demand, not enough capacity but in order to increase capacity you need money to invest. In this case the constraint isn’t capacity but cash. 
	1. Demand exists, but cash is unavailable to invest in the capacity needed to meet it.
5. **Management Attention:** where your business is doing well but you’re so busy handling daily operations and making every decision yourself that the business cannot grow regardless of demand, capacity or even cash.
	1. The business is constrained by the cognitive load and decision-making bandwidth of its leadership. 

Crucially, this analysis does not yield a final conclusion but rather a guiding hypothesis. As you've stated, **"The constraints start as potential hypothesis of problems, that would help me create my foundation assumptions of what I about to do next."** This hypothesis focuses the subsequent, more granular analysis on the highest-leverage area of the business.

#### **Section 1.3: The Output of the Component Analysis**
An output from this discovery framework/tool will help you come up with a brief summary that looks like this:

- Here’s a brief summary of this business:
	- There are currently 6 chiropractor offices in WA offering services
	- Only 4 of the 6 locations offer the special spinal decompression service
	- The “front-end offer” is a free consultation and treatment plan
	- The “back-end offer” is a treatment package that ranges from $2,400 to $3,600 over a 60 - 90 day period
	- 1 in 7 patients choose a special $10,000 treatment in the case of an injury
	- Revenue is about 70% from insurance and 30% payment upfront
- Metrics / KPI’s Overview: Next let’s go over the metrics / KPIs and see if we can’t get a better idea about this business.
	- Top line
		- **Top line revenue per location:** $5.2 million
		- **Net profit per location:** $1.2 million which means
		- **Net margin:** 1.2/5.2 = 23%
	- Acquisition
		- **Monthly marketing spend:** $1,500-$2,000 per month
		- **Total new leads avg:** 35 per month
		- **Total shows for free consultation:** 28 (80% show rate)
		- **Total sales for full treatment:** 20 (71% close rate)
		- **Customer acquisition cost (CAC):** $700 per year
	- Retention
		- **Lifetime Value (LTV) per customer:** $3,400
		- **LTV/CAC ratio:** 3400/700 = 4.8
- Constraints Metrics
	- The Goal: In the video, Raymond (the owner of Chiro-1st) wants to achieve **$5 million in EBITDA in 3 years and exit.** This is definitely in the realm of outrageous goals, but we can go even further and ask “How do we 10x this business?”
	- There are only a few KPIs:
		- **Throughput** (Sales - Variable Costs)
		- **Inventory** or **Investment** (e.g. clinic location, equipment, etc)
		- **Operating Expense** (e.g. staff salaries, rent, etc.)
		- **Net Profit = Throughput - Operating Expense
		- ****ROI = (Throughput - Operating Expense) / Investment**
