- This is the final and ultimate goal of the entire process, moving beyond robustness to antifragility.
    
- This involves designing specific, high-level metrics that directly track progress against core principles.
    
- **Guiding Formula:** As you stated, `Antifragility/Success = (Convex Exposure to Randomness & Opportunity) + (Rigorous Downside Capping via Via Negativa & Barbell Strategy) + (Ensured Long-Term Survival via Ergodicity & Skin in the Game)`.
    
- **Example Metrics:** Designing a "Contribution Margin" metric to track survival, or an "Experimentation Velocity" metric to track convex exposure.
