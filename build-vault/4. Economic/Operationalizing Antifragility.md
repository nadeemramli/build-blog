Classifying business stages properties: Fragile, Robust, Antifragile.

Startup: Fragile
Known Business Model: Robust
Ecosystem: Antifragile (Well this is hard to find, but Coca Cola is pretty much antifragile)



The problem with startup is that, there's no business model. Nothing is proven yet, the product/value proposition, none of them validated, there's no customer, there's no channel for you to meet the customer, the unit of economics haven't validated to be sustainable. 

So process of developing a startup or a new product (for e-commerce) solely rely on tinkering.
