First when doing migration, please ensure the schema/table we're creating haven't created.

If we want to alter, make it ALTER instead.

We use a simple PostgreSQL schema migration.


Command to migrate, remotely to supabase:

1. After creating the schema migration, double check and ensure it's working.

Start with 

`npx supabase login`

then ensure logged in, then you can proceed, to link with project references

`npx supabase link --project-ref "project-id, you can find at the setting"`

If your connection is successful it will tells you, vice versa.

`npx supabase init`

This is how we run the database to see if the database is correctly setup/configure.



To migrate new migration. 

just simply `npx supabase db push`



npx supabase db reset
npx supabase migration up 
	(to check local schema is correct with the current)
npx supabase db push 
	to push our current local to remote
