A direct project management tools that was meant to be use how it is, it's a templatize but easy to use.

Based of our experience, we learned that our pattern in executing a work is evolving around the same. From this, emerged a new understanding where I called it "Praxis", praxis by definition is "accepted practice or custom." or it can also be "practice, as distinguished from theory.".

The key word here is practice, and custom. To me specifically, I use praxis to explain "emerging understanding and realization between tested theory/framework and learning experience from practical implementation". ^68d493

From now on in this document, whenever I refer to Praxis, please refer to the meaning above.

The problem we saw in this modern world is that tool seems to be too general, which dilute the essence of the real effectiveness/competency. For an example, you probably have the best step-by-step process to build a house, however since you're limited to a single tool (for an example, a hammer), now you have to build the house that way instead of the best way. 

We also have problems, where it seems that "praxis" has become more and more specialize and abstract. Which then left, unable to discern properly and never completed. I think Through Praxis solve this problem where "praxis" become more tangible, and easier to deliberately practice rather than a bunch of models and attempt implementation through Google Sheets.
