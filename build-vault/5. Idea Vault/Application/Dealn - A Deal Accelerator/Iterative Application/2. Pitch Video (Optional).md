Pitch Video (optional)

We'd love to get to know your team better through a brief 3-minute video introduction! We invite you to share insights about each founder's role, your company's core value proposition, and the significant problem you're addressing in the market. We're particularly interested in understanding why this challenge resonates with your team and hearing about a key milestone you've achieved so far.

  

The video can be hosted on any accessible platform (YouTube, Vimeo, or Loom). While this is **strictly optional**, we've found that these visual introductions consistently lead to more meaningful discussions and help us better understand your company's potential.



Here’s your pitch transcript, cleaned up and reorganized into logical categories so it’s easier to learn and refer back to:
