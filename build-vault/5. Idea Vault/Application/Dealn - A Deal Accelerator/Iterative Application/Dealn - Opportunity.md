# Dealn - Deals shouldn’t feel like paperwork
## Dealn combines all the steps needed to close deals and get paid -. all in one fluid motion.


## 1. Build Relationships

### People and companies that matter. Trust that converts.

Closing deals begins with building real relationships with the right people. Our simple CRM helps you understand the company you’re working with - their structure, decision-makers, and what matters to each contact. Build intuitive organization charts that reveal who influences what, and never let a promising relationship slip through the cracks.

Your pipeline isn’t just a list of potential deals - it’s your roadmap to revenue. See exactly where each opportunity stands, what actions move deals forward, and which relationships need attention today.

This CRM data becomes the foundation for every interaction, roadmap, and document you create.

## 2. Capture Every Conversation

### Meetings that move deals forward. Nothing gets forgotten.

Automatically record, transcribe, and analyze video call meetings to capture every crucial detail. Had a meeting where your prospect mentioned that game-changing requirement? Promised a specific deliverable that needs to be in the contract? Those golden moments that make or break deals are now automatically preserved and searchable.

Beyond video calls, manually input conversations from WhatsApp, email, LinkedIn, and other channels. Mark interactions as relationship touchpoints or tag them as project-specific discussions. Everything discussed becomes instantly available when you’re crafting proposals, building roadmaps, or following up on commitments.

Your conversations become your competitive advantage.

## 3. Plan Out Your Work

### Projects and roadmaps that win confidence before you even pitch.

Show your prospects exactly how you’ll deliver success. Build comprehensive roadmaps, set clear milestones, create detailed statements of work, and define precise scopes that demonstrate your process, timeline, and expertise. When clients see you’ve thought through every step, they’re already halfway to saying yes.

Each project becomes a collection of deal portals - guided experiences that take clients from initial interest to final delivery. Your roadmap isn’t just planning; it’s selling.

## 4. Create Deal Portals

### Branded experiences that close deals, not just documents.

Forget sending PDFs. Create deal portals - branded, interactive experiences that guide your clients through your entire process. Every document, invoice, quotation, and business file lives within the deal portal. Think of it as a branded folder that transforms how clients experience working with you.

### Create Perfect Documents

No design skills needed. Perfect every time. Set up your template, fonts, and colors once, and every portal maintains your brand standards automatically. All your content fits automatically, none of your staff need design skills, and you can collaborate in real time, just like Google Docs.

### Get It Signed

Legally binding. Everyone’s covered. Perfect timing. Digital signatures aren’t new, but asking for them at the right moment is. Getting the signature at the exact moment they’ve made their decision speeds up your sales process, removes buyer remorse, and reinforces their confidence in you.

### Onboard Seamlessly

Branded, step-by-step onboarding that starts relationships right. A smooth process that begins the moment your client signs. 100% customizable, looks and feels like part of your deal portal. The perfect way to begin every relationship.

## 5. Send Interactive Experiences

### Your clients don’t want PDFs. They want to be impressed.

This is your moment. Your client opens your deal portal through a web link - professional, not spammy. They can read comfortably on any device, add options, ask questions via live chat, and watch you make real-time updates.

You get notified the second they open it and see exactly what sections they’ve read, in what order, and for how long. Intelligence that turns follow-ups from guesswork into strategic moves.

## 6. Track What Matters

### Analytics that reveal which deals will close and why.

See beyond opens and clicks. Track engagement patterns that predict deal outcomes. Which sections do successful clients spend time on? What content correlates with faster signatures? Which follow-up timing converts best?

Get insights on team performance, deal velocity, and client behavior patterns. Turn your deal data into your competitive advantage with analytics designed specifically for deal-closers, not just document creators.

How can I create an app like this?

The main structure of the app should be something like this. User register and onboard at get.dealn.app

However during their onboard they can set subdomain.dealn.app.

If I wanna build a structure like this, can you suggest tech infrastructure for it?

## 7. Learn and Showcase

### Turn completed projects into future wins.

Close projects properly, but never lose the valuable work you’ve created. Automatically compile your best deliverables into a collection of case studies and brag docs that showcase your expertise to future prospects.

Learn from every project with comprehensive postmortem analysis backed by real data. See what worked, what didn’t, and how to improve your process for the next deal. Your past successes become the foundation for future wins.
