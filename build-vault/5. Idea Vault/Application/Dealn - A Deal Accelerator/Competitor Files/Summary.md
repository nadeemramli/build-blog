better proposals 

have the same user onboarding


recommended task/checklist when user onboard


to have our own simple CRM, does it bring value?
what about those who invested in their own CRM?

better proposals have better design philosophy,
every client got sent a Project portal, within those portal you can arrange documents within it with ability to give form etc, you can also create an onboarding text such as to add this email etc etc. 



many of these deal accelerator tools was meant to only achieve their vanity objective.

all these was to create better document

but that wasn't the point, the point of creating better documents is to impress your client, not that, but also to convince your client of your standard. 

but that won't win you deal, that would just create a fancy document that wow people but never read it.

better documents only helps you to develop better content (so client would understand what they will get), make it smooth



idea:
lock contract as ambassador and get lifetime deal



the idea is that we have a prospect,

target, they don't know us
inbound, they kinda know us

engage is where we build relationships,
direct - sales demo, emails, events, reps
indirect - branded (go through online demo, academy, free resources, uses you as references etc)


more engagement 
better deal
