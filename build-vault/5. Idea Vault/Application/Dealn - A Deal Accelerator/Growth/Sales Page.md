- ## Create
    
    ### No design skill needed.  
    Perfect every time.
    
    Wouldn’t it be great if you set up your template, fonts and colors once and it always looked perfect? All your content fits automatically, none of your staff need design skills, and you can collaborate in real time, just like Google Docs.
    
    It’s your job to think about your client and come up with solutions to their problems. It’s ours to make sure your proposal gets you the deal.

- ## Send
    
    ### Your client doesn’t want a PDF. They want a great experience.
    
    This is your moment to impress. Your client opens your proposal through a web link, not a spammy attachment. They can comfortably read it on whatever device they open it on. Because it’s interactive, they can add on options or ask you questions via live chat, and you can even make changes in real time.
    
    To top it off, you get notified the second they open it and see exactly what sections they’ve read, in what order, and for how long.

- ## Get it Signed
    
    ### Legally binding. Everyone’s covered.
    
    Asking clients to print, sign, scan, and email PDFs back is over.
    
    Digital signatures aren’t new, but asking for them at the right time is. Getting the signature at the exact moment they’ve made their decision speeds up the sales process, removes buyer remorse, and reinforces confidence in you.
    
    You only need one digital signature platform - it might as well be the one you create your proposals in.

## Onboard

### Branded, step-by-step onboarding - right after signing.

The worst way to welcome a new client? A disjointed set of emails with different people CC’d in, chasing information and payments, and finding the endless “comments in red”. Not classy.

Now, that’s all handled by a smooth, step-by-step process that starts the moment your client signs. 100% customizable and looks and feels like part of the proposal. The perfect way to start a relationship.

## Manage Teams

### Control your team. Manage what’s sent. Full visibility.

A mess of off-brand documents, mixed messaging, and team members accidentally stepping on each other’s toes? Not exactly the secret to winning deals.

Now, your team works in sync. Every document is polished, every message on-brand, and every approval handled smoothly. Set permissions, control what’s sent, and keep track of deals without the chaos.
