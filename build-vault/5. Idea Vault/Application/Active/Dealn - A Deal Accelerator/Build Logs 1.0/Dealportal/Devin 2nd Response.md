Based on your goal to build a superpower document builder within the deal portal system, I can analyze the dependencies and prerequisites needed.

## Current Architecture Analysis 

The `DealPortalBuilder` already has the foundational structure for your advanced builders with four page types defined: `blank`, `document`, `form`, and `embed`. DealPortalBuilder.tsx:80-93 However, these are currently just placeholders with basic UI mockups. DealPortalBuilder.tsx:635-670

## Critical Dependencies & Prerequisites 

### 1. **Public Portal Viewer (Highest Priority)** 

Before building advanced builders, you **must** complete the public portal viewing infrastructure. Without this, none of your document/form builders will be functional for end users. The current system can only save portal data but can't serve it publicly.

### 2. **Block Rendering System Enhancement** 

The current `renderBlock` function only handles basic blocks (heading, text, image, button). DealPortalBuilder.tsx:929-951 You'll need to extend this significantly to support:

- Document blocks (proposals, contracts, invoices)
- Form blocks (input fields, validation, submissions)
- Embed blocks (iframes, widgets)

### 3. **Data Persistence Architecture** 

The current `DealPortal` interface stores pages as a simple array, but complex documents/forms will need:

- Rich content storage (JSON schemas for documents)
- Form submission handling
- File upload capabilities
- Version control for documents

## Potential Future Problems 

### **Complexity Cascade** 

Building all four builders simultaneously will create interdependencies:

- Document builder needs form elements (signatures, approvals)
- Form builder needs document templates
- Both need embed capabilities for payments/integrations

### **Performance Issues** 

The current block system loads everything in memory. DealPortalBuilder.tsx:204-220 Complex documents with many blocks could cause performance problems.

### **State Management Complexity** 

The current `useState` approach for portal data will become unwieldy with complex nested document structures.

## Recommended Development Plan 

### **Phase 1: Foundation (Critical)** 

1. Build public portal viewer component
2. Add public routing for `/{slug}`
3. Implement subdomain-based portal serving
4. Extend block rendering system

### **Phase 2: Document Builder** 

1. Create rich text editor integration
2. Build template system for proposals/contracts
3. Add variable interpolation from project data
4. Implement PDF generation

### **Phase 3: Form Builder** 

1. Build drag-drop form field system
2. Add validation and submission handling
3. Create Typeform-like single-page experience
4. Integrate with document builder for approvals

### **Phase 4: Advanced Features** 

1. Embed builder for third-party widgets
2. Workflow automation between builders
3. Analytics and tracking

## Technical Prerequisites 

You'll need to add these dependencies:

- Rich text editor (TipTap, Quill, or similar)
- PDF generation library
- Form validation library (Zod integration)
- File upload handling (Supabase Storage)

The current block type definitions show you're already planning for this complexity with business blocks like `proposal`, `invoice`, and `contract`. DealPortalBuilder.tsx:141-146

**Bottom line**: Complete the public portal viewer first, then build the document builder as your MVP before tackling forms and embeds. This sequential approach will prevent architectural debt and ensure each builder can actually be used by end users.

## Notes 

The current codebase shows good architectural planning with the page type system and block categories already defined. The main risk is trying to build all builders simultaneously without the foundational viewing infrastructure in place.
