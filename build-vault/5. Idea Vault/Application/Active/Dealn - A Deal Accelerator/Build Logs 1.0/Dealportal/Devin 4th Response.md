Based on my analysis of the repository, I need to clarify that there isn't a standalone document specifically titled "Recommended Development Plan" or "Technical Prerequisites" for the deal portal system. However, the existing development guidance and technical requirements are distributed across several key documents that provide the foundation for building the public portal viewer and document builder with project variables.

## Existing Development Plan Framework 

The repository contains a structured **Efficiency Analysis Report** that serves as a development prioritization framework. EFFICIENCY_REPORT.md:124-151 This report provides a three-tier implementation priority system with specific optimization targets for React components, database queries, and performance improvements.

The efficiency report identifies high-priority tasks including **ProjectEngagements Component Optimization**, medium-priority tasks like **ContactDataTable Optimization** and **Dashboard Component Optimization**, and low-priority future improvements such as **Form State Optimization** and **Database Query Enhancements**. EFFICIENCY_REPORT.md:126-150

## Technical Prerequisites and Installation Requirements 

The comprehensive technical prerequisites are documented in the **Setup Guide**, which outlines the complete technology stack and installation requirements. SETUP_GUIDE.md:8-13 The prerequisites include Node.js 18+, Supabase project setup, Vercel account, GitHub account, and Cursor editor with MCP support.

The core technology stack is defined in the package.json dependencies, establishing the technical foundation with React 18.3.1, TypeScript 5.5.3, Vite 5.4.1, Supabase for backend services, and Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui for the frontend. package.json:30-89

## Public Portal Viewer and Document Builder Architecture 

The **Deal Portal System** documentation provides the architectural blueprint for both the public portal viewer and document builder functionality. DealPortalBuilder.tsx:1-1174 The system consists of three main components: DealPortalBuilder (visual editor), ProjectDealportals (management interface), and ProjectVariables (context & variables).

The document builder supports multiple block categories including basic, interactive, business, and media blocks, with specific page types for blank composition, document generation, forms, and embed integration. The system manages portal state through comprehensive CRUD operations and provides template-based portal creation.

## Project Variables Integration 

The **ProjectVariables** component manages both auto-generated context variables and custom user-defined variables for use in portals. ProjectVariables.tsx:1-750 The system automatically generates comprehensive context variables from project data, company data, contact data, meetings, conversations, and portal statistics.

Custom variables support multiple data types (string, number, boolean, date, email, url) with security handling for sensitive variables, and can be accessed in portal content using template syntax `{{variable.key}}`.

## Specific Build Tasks Translation 

Based on the task management guidelines, the development process should follow a structured approach with markdown-based task tracking. task-lists.mdc:12-82 Tasks should be organized into Completed, In Progress, and Future sections with detailed implementation plans and relevant file documentation.

The available npm scripts provide the build automation framework, including development (`npm run dev`), production builds (`npm run build`), testing (`npm run test`), deployment (`npm run deploy`), and monitoring setup (`npm run monitor:setup-free`). package.json:6-28

## Detailed Task Roadmap Framework 

For the public portal viewer, the roadmap should prioritize:

1. **Component optimization** following the efficiency report priorities
2. **Portal sharing system** implementation with subdomain-based routing
3. **Public access controls** including password protection and invite-only settings
4. **Analytics integration** for portal view tracking

For the document builder leveraging project variables:

1. **Variable system enhancement** with improved template syntax support
2. **Block type expansion** for business document generation
3. **Template system optimization** with predefined document types
4. **Context variable automation** for dynamic content population

## Installation and Environment Setup 

The setup process requires environment configuration with Supabase credentials, optional analytics integration, and GitHub token setup for MCP integration. SETUP_GUIDE.md:17-50 The monitoring stack setup provides zero-cost production monitoring with enterprise-grade capabilities.

## Notes 

The existing documentation provides a solid foundation for development planning, but lacks a centralized development roadmap document. The efficiency report serves as a prioritization framework, while the setup guide covers technical prerequisites. The Deal Portal System wiki provides comprehensive architectural guidance for both public portal viewing and document building with project variables. To create a complete development plan, these distributed resources would need to be synthesized into a unified roadmap document following the task management guidelines outlined in the repository.
