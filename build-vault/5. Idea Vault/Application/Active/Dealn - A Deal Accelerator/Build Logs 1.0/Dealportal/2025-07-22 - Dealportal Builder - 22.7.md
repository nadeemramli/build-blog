## 🤖 Devin DeepWiki Sessions

### Session 1

**My Prompt:**

```
[Great, the app now currently can't be use properly due to the fact the deal portal function are not properly functional. The stuff that we have currently in the dealportal page, the one that we love is the ability to add pages, responsive design option, page settings on the right, blocks in the middle, the add blocks function, content to workflow to share journey all of that. However we're unable to actually create a functional portal, portal once created should be able to view on their subdomain and urls. As you can see in our architecture, when user signing up to their app, they need to setup their subdomain, and that exactly what we have setup, their subdomain belong to their organization which then they can access (login to it), and aswell use that as the link for sharing a deal portal. the dealportal page-slug is customizable, so user can send exactly that page slug with the subdomain to send the portal. I think before we proceed developing anything else, this is the first thing needed to be done right?]
```

**Devin Response Summary:**

## **Key Takeaways:**

**New Tasks Generated:**
## What Needs to Be Built 

You need to create:

1. **Public Portal Viewer Component** - A component that fetches portal data by slug and renders the portal content without requiring authentication
2. **Public Route** - Add a route like `/:slug` that serves the portal viewer
3. **Portal Rendering Logic** - Logic to render the portal blocks/pages based on the saved portal structure
4. **Subdomain Context** - Ensure the portal viewer can determine which organization's portal to serve based on the subdomain

### Session 2

**My Prompt:**

```
[Great, so based of this list of what needs to be build, can you check for any dependencies problem, or there's potential problem in the future provided that goal is to build a superpower document builder inside the dealportal builder 

(blocks builder, document builder, form builder, embed)

Not just dependencies, what about pre-requisite, do we have to build something else first before starting building this etc? What's the plan here? ]
```

**Devin Response Summary:**

> [Paste/summarize key insights here]

## **Key Takeaways:**

**New Tasks Generated:**
## Recommended Development Plan 

### **Phase 1: Foundation (Critical)** 

1. Build public portal viewer component
2. Add public routing for `/{slug}`
3. Implement subdomain-based portal serving
4. Extend block rendering system

### **Phase 2: Document Builder** 

1. Create rich text editor integration
2. Build template system for proposals/contracts
3. Add variable interpolation from project data
4. Implement PDF generation

### **Phase 3: Form Builder** 

1. Build drag-drop form field system
2. Add validation and submission handling
3. Create Typeform-like single-page experience
4. Integrate with document builder for approvals

### **Phase 4: Advanced Features** 

1. Embed builder for third-party widgets
2. Workflow automation between builders
3. Analytics and tracking

## Technical Prerequisites 

You'll need to add these dependencies:

- Rich text editor (Quill)
- PDF generation library
- Form validation library (Zod integration)
- File upload handling (Supabase Storage)

### Session 3

**My Prompt:**

```
A little correction, dealportal is a multi-page portal. Meaning when user wanting to create a new page, they can either choose Rich Text Editor (which is a blank page, with blocks function) Or they can choose Document Builder, which like Plutio, you can build all documents inside it (it got invoice generator, legal documents like contract etc generator) As you can see, we have Project variables being passed to the projects folder, the folder here being Dealportal, dealportal can use the project variables in their document creation, removing the needs to manually kick in the document data.]
