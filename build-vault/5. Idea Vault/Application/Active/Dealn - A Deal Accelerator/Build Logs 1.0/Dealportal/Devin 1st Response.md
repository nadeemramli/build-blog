You're absolutely right - this is a critical issue that needs to be addressed first. Based on the codebase, I can see that while the deal portal builder interface is well-developed, there's a missing piece in the portal viewing/serving infrastructure.

## Current State Analysis 

The deal portal system has these working components:

**Portal Builder Interface** - The `DealPortalBuilder` component provides a comprehensive visual editor with pages, blocks, responsive design options, and settings panels. DealPortalBuilder.tsx:188-221 It saves portal data to the `deal_portals` table with customizable slugs. DealPortalBuilder.tsx:1045-1057

**Subdomain Infrastructure** - Your multi-tenant architecture is properly set up where organizations get subdomains during onboarding. Onboarding.tsx:196-205 The system redirects users to their organization subdomain after setup. Onboarding.tsx:396-400

**Portal Management** - The `ProjectDealportals` component shows portal URLs are constructed as `${organizationSubdomain}.dealn.app/${portal.slug}` and provides "View Live" functionality. ProjectDealportals.tsx:571-575

## The Missing Piece 

The critical gap is that there's **no public portal viewing route or component** to serve the actual portals at those URLs. The current routing in `App.tsx` only includes authenticated routes like `/dealportals` for management, but no public route to display portals at `/{slug}`. App.tsx:240-248

## What Needs to Be Built 

You need to create:

1. **Public Portal Viewer Component** - A component that fetches portal data by slug and renders the portal content without requiring authentication
2. **Public Route** - Add a route like `/:slug` that serves the portal viewer
3. **Portal Rendering Logic** - Logic to render the portal blocks/pages based on the saved portal structure
4. **Subdomain Context** - Ensure the portal viewer can determine which organization's portal to serve based on the subdomain

The portal URLs are already being generated correctly (`organizationSubdomain.dealn.app/portal-slug`), but there's no corresponding route handler to serve the actual portal content at those URLs. ProjectDealportals.tsx:304-306

You're correct that this should be the top priority - without functional portal viewing, the entire deal portal system is incomplete despite having a sophisticated builder interface.

## Notes 

The subdomain routing infrastructure via Vercel is already configured to handle subdomain-based requests, and the portal data structure supports the rendering requirements. The main development effort should focus on creating the public portal viewing experience.
