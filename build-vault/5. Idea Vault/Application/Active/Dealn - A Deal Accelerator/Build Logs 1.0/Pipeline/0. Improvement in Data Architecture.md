The goal with the homepage is to let user in tact with their Deal situation.

They need to know: 

1. How's their Relationship looks like: 
	1. they can see total new contacts, companies
	2. active contacts, companies
	3. relapse contacts, companies.
2. How's their Engagement Looks like: 
	1. they can see total meetings
	2. conversations captured on a specific date

3. How their Deal pipeline looks like
	1. Project status
		1. New, progress, pending, delayed, won, lost
	2. Deal portal status
		1. Draft, Sent, Viewed, Action Pending, Completed, Active, Stalled, Expired, Closed.


for contacts, need to implement new, active, and relapse function.
for engagement simple


for project, need to ensure those status is properly implemented
same with deal portal status
	Need to add status in dealportal builder

need to add function for dealportal (transactional vs. alive)

Of course. Using your finalized table as the single source of truth, here is a detailed educational breakdown of each Deal Portal status. This guide explains what each status means, which portal types it applies to, and the specific actions or implications for the user.

### The Dealn Guide to Deal Portal Statuses

Understanding the status of your `Deal Portals` is fundamental to managing your pipeline and maintaining **momentum**. Each status provides a clear signal about where your deal stands and what action is required next. This system is designed to handle both one-time **Transactional Portals** (proposals, contracts) and ongoing **Alive Portals** (client hubs, invoice portals).

---

### Status Breakdown

#### **`Draft`**

- **Phase:** Preparation
    
- **What it means:** This is the initial stage of any portal. It is being created and edited internally by you. It is not live and cannot be accessed by your client.
    
- **Applies to:** All Portal Types (Transactional and Alive).
    
- **User Action / Implication:** This is your workspace. Finalize the content, set the portal type (`Alive Portal?` = TRUE/FALSE), and prepare it for sending.
    

#### **`Sent`**

- **Phase:** In-Flight
    
- **What it means:** You have sent the portal link to the client. The system is now waiting for the client to open it for the first time. The "ball is in their court."
    
- **Applies to:** All Portal Types.
    
- **User Action / Implication:** Monitor this status. If a portal remains `Sent` for more than a day or two, a gentle follow-up may be needed to ensure your email was received and seen.
    

#### **`Viewed`**

- **Phase:** In-Flight
    
- **What it means:** Success! The client has clicked the link and opened the portal. This is the first positive signal of engagement and the start of real **momentum**.
    
- **Applies to:** All Portal Types.
    
- **User Action / Implication:** This is a pivotal status. From here, the portal's lifecycle will diverge based on its type. Monitor for the next action.
    

#### **`Action Pending`**

- **Phase:** In-Flight
    
- **What it means:** The client is engaged but is currently stopped at a critical step that requires their input, such as signing a document, filling out a form, or making a payment.
    
- **Applies to:** Primarily used for Transactional Portals (`Alive Portal?` = FALSE) as they move toward completion.
    
- **User Action / Implication:** This is the most critical alert. Your deal is paused. The status pinpoints the exact bottleneck, allowing you to follow up with a highly specific and helpful nudge.
    

#### **`Active`**

- **Phase:** In-Flight
    
- **What it means:** The portal is now a live, operational hub for your client. This status is triggered after a portal marked as an `Alive Portal` is `Viewed`.
    
- **Applies to:** Exclusive to Alive Portals (`Alive Portal?` = TRUE).
    
- **User Action / Implication:** The portal will remain in this state for its lifecycle, serving as a continuous point of contact. You can now use it to send new invoices, share project updates, etc. The goal is to keep this portal as a valuable, ongoing resource for your client.
    

#### **`Completed`**

- **Phase:** Concluded
    
- **What it means:** The client has successfully finished all required steps in a transactional workflow. The deal is won.
    
- **Applies to:** Exclusive to Transactional Portals (`Alive Portal?` = FALSE). This is the "win" state for a one-time deal.
    
- **User Action / Implication:** Congratulations! The primary purpose of this portal is fulfilled. Initiate your onboarding process or next steps for project delivery.
    

#### **`Stalled`**

- **Phase:** Concluded
    
- **What it means:** **Momentum is lost.** A defined period of inactivity has passed since the portal was last `Sent` or `Viewed`.
    
- **Applies to:** All Portal Types.
    
- **User Action / Implication:** This is an urgent warning. For a transactional deal, it means it's at risk of being lost. For an `Active` portal, it means your client is disengaged. It's time to proactively re-engage them to get things moving again.
    

#### **`Expired`**

- **Phase:** Concluded
    
- **What it means:** The portal had a hard deadline for an offer or action, and that date has now passed. The portal may no longer be accessible to the client.
    
- **Applies to:** All Portal Types (though more common for transactional offers).
    
- **User Action / Implication:** The deal is considered lost due to time. This is a chance to analyze your sales process. Was the deadline too short? Was there not enough follow-up?
    

#### **`Closed`**

- **Phase:** Concluded
    
- **What it means:** The portal has been manually marked as lost by you. This could be because the client chose a competitor or the project was cancelled.
    
- **Applies to:** All Portal Types.
    
- **User Action / Implication:** This is a housekeeping action that cleans your active pipeline and ensures your analytics and reports are accurate.
    

### Summary of Lifecycles

Transactional Portal Lifecycle (Alive Portal? = FALSE):

Draft → Sent → Viewed → Action Pending → Completed

Alive Portal Lifecycle (Alive Portal? = TRUE):

Draft → Sent → Viewed → Active

_(Both lifecycles can end in `Stalled`, `Expired`, or `Closed` if they do not reach their intended final state.)_
