Looking at your Form Forge Domains codebase, you're asking about optimizing expensive functions to reduce computational costs. Based on your efficiency report and the code I can see, there are several expensive operations that need optimization.

## Current Expensive Functions Identified 

### 1. **Dashboard Date Operations** 

The most expensive function I can see is in your Dashboard component where date filtering happens on every render: Dashboard.tsx:64-86

This code runs expensive date operations (`new Date()`, `isToday()`, `isTomorrow()`, `isThisWeek()`) on every render without memoization.

### 2. **Analytics Monthly Growth Query** 

Your analytics dashboard performs extremely expensive database operations: AnalyticsDashboard.tsx:47-110

This function executes 60 database queries (5 tables × 12 months) in parallel, which is computationally expensive and could hit rate limits.

### 3. **Deal Portal Grouping Operations** 

The portal list component performs expensive array operations: DealPortalList.tsx:153-162

## Optimization Strategies 

### **1. Implement React Memoization** 

Your efficiency report already identifies this as high priority: EFFICIENCY_REPORT.md:9-37

**Solution for Dashboard:**

```
const upcomingMeetings = useMemo(() =>     meetings.filter((meeting) => {      const meetingDate = new Date(meeting.start_time);      return (        meetingDate >= new Date() &&        (isToday(meetingDate) || isTomorrow(meetingDate) || isThisWeek(meetingDate))      );    }).slice(0, 4),     [meetings]  );
```

### **2. Optimize Database Queries** 

You already have an optimized query system: useOptimizedQuery.ts:1-30

But the analytics queries need batching. Instead of 60 separate queries, use a single query with date ranges.

### **3. Implement Query Caching** 

Your query optimization utility has good caching patterns: queryOptimization.ts:169-199

## Best Practices for Managing Expensive Functions 

### **1. Use React.memo and useMemo Consistently** 

Wrap expensive components and computations as recommended in your efficiency report: EFFICIENCY_REPORT.md:126-142

### **2. Implement Proper Caching Strategy** 

Your optimized query hook already implements caching: useOptimizedQuery.ts:14-28

### **3. Use Batch Operations** 

Your query optimization utility provides batching capabilities: queryOptimization.ts:82-104

## Implementation Priority 

Based on your efficiency report, focus on:

1. **High Priority**: Dashboard component memoization (immediate 60-80% performance improvement)
2. **Medium Priority**: Analytics query batching
3. **Low Priority**: Portal list optimizations

The key is to implement these optimizations systematically, starting with the highest impact areas identified in your comprehensive efficiency analysis.

**Notes**

Your codebase already has good optimization infrastructure in place with the optimized query system and caching utilities. The main issue is applying these patterns consistently across all expensive operations, particularly in the dashboard and analytics components.
