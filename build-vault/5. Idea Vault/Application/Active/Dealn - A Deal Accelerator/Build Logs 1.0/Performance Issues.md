Based on your codebase analysis, you're asking about improving the overall user experience and perceived robustness of your Form Forge Domains application, which is a B2B SaaS platform for creating deal portals with CRM functionality.

## Current Performance Issues Identified 

Your application already has a comprehensive efficiency analysis documented in EFFICIENCY_REPORT.md:1-209 . The report identifies several key areas that contribute to the "janky" feeling:

### 1. **Missing React Memoization (High Impact)** 

Multiple components lack proper memoization, causing unnecessary re-renders EFFICIENCY_REPORT.md:9-37 . This directly impacts the tactile responsiveness you're comparing to app.devin.ai.

### 2. **Expensive Operations on Every Render** 

Components like the dashboard are performing heavy computations without optimization Dashboard.tsx:64-86 . Date operations and array filtering run repeatedly, creating perceived lag.

### 3. **Query Optimization Gaps** 

While you have an optimized query system useOptimizedQuery.ts:1-30 , some components still make inefficient database calls that could benefit from better batching.

## Immediate Improvements for Robustness 

### **1. Implement Loading States and Skeleton UI** 

Your current layout Layout.tsx:71-137 lacks sophisticated loading states. Add skeleton screens and progressive loading to match the polished feel of professional applications.

### **2. Add Micro-interactions and Transitions** 

The efficiency report mentions missing `useCallback` for event handlers EFFICIENCY_REPORT.md:113-123 . Implement smooth transitions and hover states to create that "tactile" feeling.

### **3. Optimize Heavy Components** 

Your analytics dashboard performs multiple expensive operations AnalyticsDashboard.tsx:47-110 . Implement the memoization patterns suggested in your efficiency report.

### **4. Enhanced Error Handling** 

While you have Sentry integration main.tsx:10-24 , implement graceful error boundaries and user-friendly error states throughout the application.

## Technical Architecture Improvements 

### **1. Implement Progressive Enhancement** 

Your current stack with React Query and Supabase package.json:61-62 is solid, but add optimistic updates and offline-first patterns.

### **2. Add Performance Monitoring** 

You already have Vercel Speed Insights main.tsx:37 , but implement real-time performance tracking to identify bottlenecks.

### **3. Enhance the Query Layer** 

Your optimized query hook has good caching useOptimizedQuery.ts:14-28 , but implement query deduplication and request batching as suggested in your efficiency report.

## UI/UX Polish Recommendations 

1. **Consistent Loading States**: Replace instant state changes with smooth transitions
2. **Feedback Systems**: Add toast notifications, progress indicators, and confirmation dialogs
3. **Responsive Interactions**: Implement hover states, focus management, and keyboard navigation
4. **Visual Hierarchy**: Enhance spacing, typography, and color consistency using your existing Radix UI components package.json:32-58

## Implementation Priority 

Start with the high-impact optimizations already identified in your efficiency report, particularly the React memoization improvements. Then focus on adding the micro-interactions and loading states that create the "robust" feeling you're seeking.

**Notes**

Your application has solid technical foundations with comprehensive monitoring and a modern tech stack. The "janky" feeling likely stems from performance issues and missing UI polish rather than fundamental architectural problems. The efficiency report provides a clear roadmap for addressing the most impactful performance bottlenecks.
