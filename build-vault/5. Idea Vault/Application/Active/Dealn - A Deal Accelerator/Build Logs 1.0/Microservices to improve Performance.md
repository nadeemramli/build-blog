Based on your React/TypeScript application built with Vite and Supabase, there are several potential areas where Go or Rust could be integrated to enhance performance and capabilities.

## Current Architecture Analysis 

Your application is currently a full-stack TypeScript solution using React frontend with Supabase as the backend-as-a-service package.json:30-90 . The main entry point initializes Sentry error tracking, PostHog analytics, and Vercel Speed Insights main.tsx:10-37 .

## Potential Integration Points 

### 1. **PDF Generation Service (High Impact)** 

Your roadmap mentions PDF generation for document export dealportal-task.md:44-48 . Instead of using `jspdf html2canvas` in the browser, you could build a dedicated Go or Rust microservice for:

- Server-side PDF generation with better performance
- Template processing with variable interpolation
- Document watermarking and security features

### 2. **Document Template Engine (Medium Impact)** 

The planned document template system for proposals, invoices, and contracts dealportal-task.md:19-23 could benefit from a Go/Rust service that:

- Processes Handlebars templates faster than JavaScript
- Handles complex variable interpolation logic
- Manages template caching and optimization

### 3. **Analytics Processing (Medium Impact)** 

Your application includes portal analytics tracking types.ts:671-676 . A Go/Rust service could:

- Process analytics data in real-time
- Generate performance reports
- Handle data aggregation more efficiently than JavaScript

### 4. **Subdomain Management (Low-Medium Impact)** 

The Vercel API integration for domain management vercelApi.ts:23-42 could be enhanced with a Go/Rust service for:

- Bulk domain operations
- DNS management automation
- SSL certificate handling

## Implementation Approach 

### **Microservices Architecture** 

Rather than rewriting the entire application, you could introduce Go/Rust services as microservices that integrate with your existing Supabase backend:

1. **Keep the React frontend** - It's working well for your portal viewer and builder interfaces
2. **Maintain Supabase** - For authentication, database, and real-time features
3. **Add specialized services** - For compute-intensive tasks like PDF generation and template processing

### **API Gateway Pattern** 

You could use Vercel Edge Functions or a dedicated API gateway to route requests between your existing TypeScript API and new Go/Rust services.

## Recommendation 

**Start with PDF generation in Go** - This would provide immediate value for your document builder roadmap while being relatively isolated from your existing codebase. Go's excellent PDF libraries (like `gofpdf` or `chromedp` for HTML-to-PDF) would significantly outperform browser-based solutions.

The existing TypeScript infrastructure should remain as your primary stack since it's already well-integrated with Supabase and handles your portal management effectively .

## Notes 

Your current stack is well-suited for the B2B SaaS portal functionality. Go/Rust would be most beneficial for specific performance-critical services rather than a complete rewrite. The multi-tenant architecture with subdomain routing is already working effectively in TypeScript.
