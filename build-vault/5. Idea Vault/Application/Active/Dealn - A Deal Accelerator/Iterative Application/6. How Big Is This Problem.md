**How big is this problem?** The problem of fragmented sales processes and inefficient deal closure is immense, spanning across all business sizes but particularly acute for MSMEs who underutilize technology. Dealn aims to become a $100M revenue business by capturing significant market share within the converging sales technology landscape. We achieve this by directly impacting "deal velocity"—how quickly sales opportunities convert into revenue—a critical metric for businesses seeking faster growth and improved efficiency. By consolidating CRM, document automation, e-signatures, client portals, and analytics into a single, AI-powered platform, Dealn replaces multiple costly and inefficient tools. The market is actively seeking solutions that "simplify your tech stack" and offer "holistic integration". As businesses increasingly move towards "Digital Sales Rooms" and demand more interactive, data-driven sales experiences , Dealn is positioned to become the indispensable platform that accelerates revenue, especially for growing businesses and agencies in Southeast Asia.
