**What do your users do now without your product?** Without Dealn, our users typically rely on a fragmented and inefficient tech stack. They manage relationships in a basic CRM or spreadsheets, create proposals in Word, Excel, or Canva, send contracts via separate e-signature tools like DocuSign or Adobe Sign, and handle payments manually or through disconnected systems . Meeting notes are often manual, and analytics are limited to basic open/click rates.
