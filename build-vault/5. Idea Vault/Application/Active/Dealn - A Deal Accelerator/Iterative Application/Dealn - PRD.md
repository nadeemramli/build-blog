# Dealn - Deals shouldn’t feel like paperwork
## Dealn combines all the steps needed to close deals and get paid -. all in one fluid motion.


## 1. Build Relationships

### People and companies that matter. Trust that converts.

Closing deals begins with building real relationships with the right people. Our simple CRM helps you understand the company you’re working with - their structure, decision-makers, and what matters to each contact. Build intuitive organization charts that reveal who influences what, and never let a promising relationship slip through the cracks.

Your pipeline isn’t just a list of potential deals - it’s your roadmap to revenue. See exactly where each opportunity stands, what actions move deals forward, and which relationships need attention today.

This CRM data becomes the foundation for every interaction, roadmap, and document you create.

The CRM capable to take Contacts, Companies (these data would be variables for creating our projects). Just a simple CRM.

## 2. Capture Every Conversation

### Meetings that move deals forward. Nothing gets forgotten.

Automatically record, transcribe, and analyze video call meetings to capture every crucial detail. Had a meeting where your prospect mentioned that game-changing requirement? Promised a specific deliverable that needs to be in the contract? Those golden moments that make or break deals are now automatically preserved and searchable.

Beyond video calls, manually input conversations from WhatsApp, email, LinkedIn, and other channels. Mark interactions as relationship touchpoints or tag them as project-specific discussions. Everything discussed becomes instantly available when you’re crafting proposals, building roadmaps, or following up on commitments.

Your conversations become your competitive advantage.

### Projects and roadmaps that win confidence before you even pitch.

Show your prospects exactly how you’ll deliver success. Build comprehensive roadmaps, set clear milestones, create detailed statements of work, and define precise scopes that demonstrate your process, timeline, and expertise. When clients see you’ve thought through every step, they’re already halfway to saying yes.

Each project becomes a collection of deal portals - guided experiences that take clients from initial interest to final delivery. Your roadmap isn’t just planning; it’s selling.

## 4. Create Deal Portals

Dealportal, just like Typeform (a user journey/funnel portal), this deal portal help user create document under it, embed document, get sign etc. Dealportal carry variables for the project. Whatever documents and resources created under deal portal, will be stash under Projects as (files), user can create up to 5 dealportal under a project. This is our most importan features, it's customizable, portal builder, user can create from scratch like lu.ma event page (with themes etc) and also like typeform aswell. User can whitelabel their own portal, (add logo etc).

### Branded experiences that close deals, not just documents.

Forget sending PDFs. Create deal portals - branded, interactive experiences that guide your clients through your entire process. Every document, invoice, quotation, and business file lives within the deal portal. Think of it as a branded folder that transforms how clients experience working with you.

### Create Perfect Documents

No design skills needed. Perfect every time. Set up your template, fonts, and colors once, and every portal maintains your brand standards automatically. All your content fits automatically, none of your staff need design skills, and you can collaborate in real time, just like Google Docs.

### Get It Signed

Legally binding. Everyone’s covered. Perfect timing. Digital signatures aren’t new, but asking for them at the right moment is. Getting the signature at the exact moment they’ve made their decision speeds up your sales process, removes buyer remorse, and reinforces their confidence in you.

### Onboard Seamlessly

Branded, step-by-step onboarding that starts relationships right. A smooth process that begins the moment your client signs. 100% customizable, looks and feels like part of your deal portal. The perfect way to begin every relationship.

### Your clients don’t want PDFs. They want to be impressed.

This is your moment. Your client opens your deal portal through a web link - professional, not spammy. They can read comfortably on any device, add options, ask questions via live chat, and watch you make real-time updates.

You get notified the second they open it and see exactly what sections they’ve read, in what order, and for how long. Intelligence that turns follow-ups from guesswork into strategic moves.
