**How have you validated this need?** While Dealn is an MVP and has not yet launched publicly or run external ad campaigns, the validation for this need comes directly from our founders' four years of intensive experience as freelancers and agency owners. We have personally navigated the painful inefficiencies of managing sales deals and client relationships using a patchwork of disconnected toolsâ€”spreadsheets for contacts, separate software for proposals, another for e-signatures, and manual tracking for payments. This firsthand struggle revealed the immense time wasted on administrative tasks, the frustration of context-switching, and the direct impact these inefficiencies had on our ability to close deals quickly and effectively. This lived experience provides concrete evidence that the problem is real, pervasive, and deeply felt by businesses, particularly MSMEs and service-based companies.
