**How long have you been working on this and what have you learned about this need?** We started working on the core concept of Dealn approximately four years ago, driven by our direct experiences as freelancers and agency owners. Through this period, we've learned several non-intuitive insights about the problem:

- **The Emotional Toll of Fragmentation:** It's not just about inefficiency; the constant juggling of tools and manual processes creates significant mental fatigue and frustration, impacting productivity and morale.
- **The Hidden Value of "Digital Sales Rooms":** We initially focused on e-signatures, but realized the true differentiator is creating an _interactive, branded space_ for the entire deal, where clients feel guided and impressed, not just asked to sign a PDF. This transforms the client experience from transactional to collaborative.  
    
- **"Deal Velocity" is Paramount:** Beyond simply closing deals, the _speed_ at which they move through the pipeline directly correlates with revenue predictability and overall business health. Our solution's impact on this metric is a core value proposition.  
    
- **Engagement Analytics are Gold:** Knowing _how_ a client interacts with a proposal (which sections they read, for how long) is far more valuable than a simple "opened" notification. This intelligence empowers strategic, timely follow-ups.
