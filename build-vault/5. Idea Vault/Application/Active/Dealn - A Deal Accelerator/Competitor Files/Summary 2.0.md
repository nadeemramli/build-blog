What's the best strategy here to develop the most basic MVP, that can portray the app value proposition. As you can see, the most important part of the app is the dealportal, the dealportal helps user create a smooth experience for their client to get to agreement with proposal, document signing, getting invoice. The deal portal is like a mini-funnel builder, where user can create what ever flows they want, it can be use to create a comprehensive onboarding experience, comprehensive closing experience, comprehensive survey/off-boarding, reporting compilation. (We also highly encourage user to embed third party information, for an example, if they want to create much detailed proposal, they can embed Figma slide, they can also embed Google Data Studio for an example) Anything! But the dealportal work like a folder inside a project (in one project can have many dealportal), a project is like a gant-chart, kanban, statement of work. (Where the variable setup on project, is almost like environment variable, where any dealportal under it aware of the variable (auto-detect project start date and end date, for proposal/contract etc) To setup a project, it's required to setup contacts/companies, which where the CRM's help. Any work/discussion, meetings, regarding the project, can be assign in Capture feature, where any meetings you have, any discussion you have, then can be capture and tag/assign to project. (This info can be use for "project" context). Which inside dealportal, we can create "LLM" like features to develop, proposal etc, and this LLM can use context from Capture feature. Any project that is closed, can be saved, which then from the project output, we can auto-generate, insights/case study etc. This feature by itself, become a bragdocs for successful project. This case study become that "company" as it's sub-domain resources, which then can be deep dive, can be referred in future project creation. Of course, we have projects/deal analytics in home dashboard. But the idea is that, with this software you can greatly build relationship, manage business documents, ensuring project deliverables, and scale your services for much better deals.


MVP:
