Referring to prd.md, as you can see the relationship connection should be more useful. 

There are few problems important to work on:

1. Card (Nodes)
2. Relationship (Edge)

Card:
1. copy mechanism didn't work
2. comment mechanism didn't work
3. can't toggle chart
4. there's icon in the card, but these icon can't be interacted?
5. better accessibility when user click a metric (bright up the color for an example)

Relationship
1. User should be able to toggle on off, "Floating Edges" https://reactflow.dev/examples/edges/floating-edges
2. Relationship instead of just colors to showcase strength/confidence and type, we can also use "animate"

UI/Accessibility:
1. Use skeletons shadcn component for better UI/UX
