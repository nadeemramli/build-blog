Referring to prd.md, as you can see the relationship connection should be more useful. 

There are few problems important to work on:

1. Card (Nodes)
2. Relationship (Edge)

Homepage:
1. Recent tab is "broken"
2. tags (use shadcn component) badge
3. list view can't be click (no toggle effect)
4. Same with all buttons etc.
5. Remove setting
6. Star mechanism
7. Filter dropdown background issue
8. canvas preview, set properly
9. Canvas card: when click dropdown background issue
10. Can't click project setting
11. Delete (use alert-dialog component from Shadcn )

In canvas
1. Sidebar: use tooltip from shadcn properly
2. Redundant helper for zoom in - zoom out
3. Minimap didn't update properly
4. Add cart dialog background issue
5. Sheets all type of sheets, background issue




Card:
1. Unable to edit text, description, add texts etc on card.
2. Badge shadcn component for all Tags etc
3. Toolbar (put on top of the card, right now the toolbar is everyway randomly, fixed it on top of the metric of that selected metric for toolbar)
4. copy mechanism didn't work
5. comment mechanism didn't work
6. can't toggle chart
7. there's icon in the card, but these icon can't be interacted?
8. better accessibility when user click a metric (bright up the color for an example)

Relationship
1. Some cards can't be connected, like Core/value card needed to connect to another core/value card.
2. we only have nodes colored here, there's no numbers, or function to click on it to open relationship sheet.
3. Nodes can be connected left right, up down cards, not just up and down. Handle position align with auto-layout position. 
4. User should be able to toggle on off, "Floating Edges" https://reactflow.dev/examples/edges/floating-edges
5. Relationship instead of just colors to showcase strength/confidence and type, we can also use "animate"

UI/Accessibility:
1. Use skeletons shadcn component for better UI/UX




Important Tasks
1. Problems: **ReactFlow subflows implementation** - ensuring proper adherence to ReactFlow's sub-flows documentation
	1. Explanation of the problem: 
		1. Issue 1: ReactFlow Sub-flows Pattern Deviation 
			1. The current group implementation treats groups as visual containers but doesn't follow ReactFlow's sub-flows pattern properly. In `CanvasPage.tsx`, groups are converted to ReactFlow nodes with a negative z-index CanvasPage.tsx:73-96 .
			2. **Problem**: ReactFlow's sub-flows documentation recommends using parent-child node relationships rather than separate group nodes. The current approach creates visual grouping but doesn't establish proper ReactFlow parent-child hierarchies.
		2. Issue 2: Group Node Management Inconsistencies 
			1. The canvas store has comprehensive group management methods canvasStore.ts:491-519 , but the implementation mixes visual grouping with logical grouping. The `addNodesToGroup` and `removeNodesFromGroup` methods update `nodeIds` arrays but don't establish ReactFlow's parent-child relationships
2. Problems: **Grouping to dashboard mechanism** - the connection between canvas groups and auto-generated dashboards
	1. Explanation of the problem: 
		1. Issue 3: Dashboard Generation Logic 
			1. The dashboard selector shows groups as dashboard options DashboardPage.tsx:187-215 , but the connection between groups and dashboard metrics may not be properly filtering based on the ReactFlow sub-flows pattern.
3. Root Cause Analysis for both problem: 
	1. **ReactFlow Pattern Mismatch**: The current implementation uses visual grouping rather than ReactFlow's recommended parent-child node structure
	2. **Missing Parent-Child Relationships**: Nodes within groups aren't established as children of parent group nodes in ReactFlow's data structure
	3. **Dashboard Filtering Logic**: The dashboard generation may not be properly filtering metrics based on true sub-flow relationships
4. Recommended Solutions 
	1. **Refactor to ReactFlow Sub-flows**: Implement proper parent-child node relationships where group nodes are parents and contained metric cards are children
	2. **Update Group Management**: Modify the canvas store to establish ReactFlow parent-child relationships when adding nodes to groups
	3. **Fix Dashboard Generation**: Ensure dashboard filtering uses the proper ReactFlow hierarchy to determine which metrics belong to each sub-flow

The current UI looks great because the visual grouping works, but the underlying ReactFlow data structure doesn't follow the sub-flows pattern, which affects both the grouping functionality and the dashboard generation mechanism.

Important Tasks:

1. Problems: **Removing fake/mock data and implementing proper Supabase CRUD operations**
	1. Explanation of the problem: Mock Data vs Real Supabase Integration
		1. The codebase currently has a **hybrid approach** where Supabase integration exists but falls back to mock data. This is evident in the projects store: projectsStore.ts:204-209
		2. The issue is that when there's no authenticated user, the system defaults to mock data instead of requiring proper authentication. projectsStore.ts:44-186
			1. **Why this is problematic:**
				1. The canvas store has async CRUD methods for Supabase but also local-only methods canvasStore.ts:22-41
				2. Components like `RelationshipSheet` use the local `updateEdge` method instead of the async `persistEdgeUpdate` RelationshipSheet.tsx:205-214
				3. This creates inconsistent data persistence where some changes persist to Supabase and others remain local-only
		3.  Solutions provided: **For CRUD operations:** Replace all local store methods with async Supabase methods and implement proper authentication requirements
2. Problems: **UI transparency issues with sheets and dialogs where components become transparent despite proper background dimming**
	1. Explanation of the problem: Component Transparency in Sheets/Dialogs
		1. The transparency issue likely stems from:
			1. **CSS backdrop-filter conflicts** - The canvas background may be interfering with sheet overlays
			2. **Z-index layering issues** - Multiple overlay components competing for proper stacking
			3. **Tailwind CSS opacity classes** being applied incorrectly to sheet content
				1. **Root cause analysis:**
					1. The app uses PostCSS and Tailwind configuration that was noted as "properly set up and working - do not modify" learned-memories.mdc:76
					2. The canvas system uses ReactFlow with custom overlays and controls CanvasPage.tsx:104-115
					3. Multiple sheet components (RelationshipSheet, CardSettingsSheet) may have conflicting backdrop styles
	2. Solutions provided: **For transparency issues:** Audit the CSS cascade between ReactFlow canvas, sheet overlays, and backdrop-filter properties to ensure proper opacity inheritance
3. Problems: **Auto-saved mechanism for the auto-layout option in the canvas, so users don't need to click auto-layout every time.**
	1. Explanation of the problem: 
		1. Current Auto-Save Implementation 
			1. The canvas already has auto-save functionality that updates the `updatedAt` timestamp whenever changes occur. Looking at the canvas store, every operation updates this field canvasStore.ts:282-283 . The UI displays this auto-save status in the canvas header CanvasPage.tsx:324-329 .
		2. Missing Auto-Layout Persistence:
			1. The issue is that **auto-layout preferences are not being persisted** in the canvas settings. Looking at the canvas store's `updateCanvasSettings` method canvasStore.ts:689-698 , it can save settings to the canvas, but there's no auto-layout preference being tracked.
		3. Root Cause Analysis 
			1. **Missing Settings Schema**: The `CanvasSettings` interface doesn't include auto-layout preferences
			2. **No Persistence Layer**: Auto-layout state is likely stored in local component state rather than the canvas store
			3. **Incomplete Auto-Save Scope**: The auto-save mechanism only covers canvas content, not user preferences
	2. Solution Approach:
		1. You need to:
			1. Extend `CanvasSettings` to include auto-layout preferences
			2. Store auto-layout state in the canvas store instead of local component state
			3. Use the existing `updateCanvasSettings` method to persist these preferences
			4. Load auto-layout preferences when the canvas initializes
			5. The auto-save infrastructure is already there CanvasLayout.tsx:371-372 - you just need to expand its scope to include layout preferences.


Based on your comprehensive list of issues across the Metrimap application, I can see these problems stem from several root causes. Let me analyze and group them systematically:

## Root Cause Analysis 

### 1. **CSS/UI Framework Issues** (Background Transparency & Styling) 

**Affected Components:**

- Homepage filter dropdowns HomePage.tsx:442-456
- Canvas card dropdowns HomePage.tsx:274-312
- All sheet components (CardSettingsSheet, RelationshipSheet) CardSettingsSheet.tsx:1-8
- Add node dialog background issues

**Root Cause:** Shadcn/UI components have CSS conflicts with ReactFlow canvas backdrop-filter and z-index layering. The transparency issues occur because sheet overlays inherit opacity from the canvas background.

### 2. **Event Handler & Interaction Issues** 

**Affected Features:**

- List view toggle buttons HomePage.tsx:472-489
- Star mechanism HomePage.tsx:248-251
- Card text editing in MetricCard MetricCard.tsx:175-183
- Copy mechanism in NodeToolbar NodeToolbar.tsx:56-58
- Chart toggle and comment interactions

**Root Cause:** Missing or incomplete event handlers. Many UI elements are styled correctly but lack proper onClick handlers or state management.

### 3. **ReactFlow Integration Issues** 

**Affected Features:**

- Minimap not updating properly CanvasPage.tsx:349-352
- Node connection restrictions (Core/Value cards)
- Handle positioning for multi-directional connections MetricCard.tsx:137-138
- Toolbar positioning CanvasPage.tsx:136-145

**Root Cause:** Incomplete ReactFlow configuration and missing custom node/edge implementations for advanced features.

### 4. **Component Architecture Issues** 

**Affected Features:**

- Badge components not using Shadcn consistently MetricCard.tsx:226-238
- Missing AlertDialog for delete operations HomePage.tsx:232-240
- Tooltip implementation in sidebar CanvasLayout.tsx:188-217

**Root Cause:** Inconsistent use of Shadcn/UI components and missing proper component implementations.

## Execution Plan 

### **Phase 1: Critical UI/UX Fixes** (High Priority) 

#### Task 1.1: Fix Background Transparency Issues

- **Problem:** All sheet/dialog components become transparent
- **Solution:**
    - Audit CSS cascade between ReactFlow and Shadcn sheets
    - Add proper z-index and backdrop-filter overrides
    - Test with CardSettingsSheet, RelationshipSheet, and dropdown menus

#### Task 1.2: Implement Missing Event Handlers

- **Problem:** Buttons and interactions don't work
- **Solution:**
    - Add onClick handlers for list/grid view toggle
    - Implement star mechanism in project store
    - Fix copy mechanism in NodeToolbar
    - Add chart toggle functionality in MetricCard

#### Task 1.3: Replace Alert Dialogs

- **Problem:** Using browser confirm() instead of Shadcn AlertDialog
- **Solution:**
    - Replace all confirm() calls with AlertDialog component
    - Implement in HomePage delete project and NodeToolbar delete card

### **Phase 2: Component Standardization** (Medium Priority) 

#### Task 2.1: Standardize Badge Components

- **Problem:** Inconsistent badge styling across app
- **Solution:**
    - Replace all custom badge implementations with Shadcn Badge
    - Update MetricCard tags, HomePage project tags, and filter badges

#### Task 2.2: Fix Tooltip Implementation

- **Problem:** Sidebar tooltips not using Shadcn properly
- **Solution:**
    - Ensure TooltipProvider wraps entire sidebar
    - Verify tooltip positioning and content

#### Task 2.3: Add Loading States

- **Problem:** No skeleton loading states
- **Solution:**
    - Implement Shadcn Skeleton components for project cards
    - Add loading states for canvas and dashboard pages

### **Phase 3: ReactFlow Enhancements** (Medium Priority) 

#### Task 3.1: Fix Node Connection System

- **Problem:** Connection restrictions and handle positioning
- **Solution:**
    - Implement proper connection validation logic
    - Add left/right handles to MetricCard
    - Align handle positions with auto-layout

#### Task 3.2: Enhance Relationship Visualization

- **Problem:** Missing edge interactions and animations
- **Solution:**
    - Add click handlers to open RelationshipSheet
    - Implement floating edges toggle
    - Add animated edges for strength/confidence visualization

#### Task 3.3: Fix Toolbar Positioning

- **Problem:** Toolbar appears randomly positioned
- **Solution:**
    - Calculate proper position relative to selected node
    - Ensure toolbar appears consistently above metric cards

### **Phase 4: Advanced Features** (Lower Priority) 

#### Task 4.1: Improve Canvas Controls

- **Problem:** Redundant zoom controls and minimap issues
- **Solution:**
    - Remove duplicate zoom controls
    - Fix minimap update mechanism
    - Ensure proper ReactFlow state synchronization

#### Task 4.2: Enhanced Accessibility

- **Problem:** Poor visual feedback for interactions
- **Solution:**
    - Add hover states and selection highlighting
    - Implement focus management for keyboard navigation
    - Add proper ARIA labels

## Implementation Strategy 

1. **Start with Phase 1** - These are blocking user interactions
2. **Focus on CSS fixes first** - Many issues stem from styling conflicts
3. **Test each component individually** - Ensure fixes don't break other functionality
4. **Use existing Shadcn components** - Don't reinvent UI patterns
5. **Maintain ReactFlow best practices** - Follow their documentation for advanced features

This systematic approach addresses the root causes while prioritizing user-blocking issues first.

**Notes**

The codebase shows a mature application with comprehensive features, but many UI interactions were implemented as placeholders during rapid development. The transparency issues are particularly critical as they affect the core user experience across multiple components.
