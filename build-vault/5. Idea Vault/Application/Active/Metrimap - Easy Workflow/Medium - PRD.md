Understanding dimension of PRD.

1. What do user need?
2. What do user want?
3. What do user should do?
4. What do user can do?
5. What do user shouldn't, can't do?


What do user need?
- To understand what user need we need to understand which user, what problem do they have, what comparative tools/solution they currently using, and how the world work as of now.
	- Understanding which user:
		- Depends on stages of business (market segment), decision maker (target market) and user archetype (ideal customer profile). 
	- Below listed is those whom probably need Metrimap. This tree design to be nesting each information together:
		- Stable -> Growth
			- ==Business Owner==
			- Product Manager
		- Growth -> Scale Up
			- Manager
			- ==Product Manager==
			- ==Growth Operator==
		- Scale Up 
			- Chief-officer
			- Manager
			- ==Team Lead==
	- Universal problem:
		- Understanding metrics/using metrics in organization effort.
		- Figuring out what to do (that moves forward), incremental effect
		- Resource allocation, prioritization
		- Moving fast (from data to strategy to data to execution to data to optimization) - insight velocity

What do user want?
- Predictable growth, a system.
	- Following understanding from [[Systematic Six-Step Process]], the function of using metric trees is to become the foundation for growth model. Growth model helps organization archive predictable growth using data: Metric trees paved the way to this, question, how do an organization achieve growth model. Growth model is a system that help organization be data-driven, course correct and fundamentally grow.

		- Growth Lever <- Impact (Confidence, Input) <- Abstraction layer from control to outcome. 
		- Data Infrastructure <- Data Architecture <- Data Strategy <- Business Strategy
