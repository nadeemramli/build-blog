We have to understand here what it meant to be data successful. 

How do using data enable us to grow our e-commerce business better, or just simply bring value to stakeholders?

Let's first understand the realm of data ecosystem. In building **data as a product**, there are differences in data products vs. data as a product. In this matter, we'll stick to understand data as a product.

[DJ Patil](https://twitter.com/dpatil), former United States Chief Data Scientist, defined a data product as:
> A product that facilitates an end goal through the use of data (from his book _Data Jujitsu: The Art of Turning Data into Product,_ 2012).

[Types of data products - by Luke Lin](https://pmdata.substack.com/p/types-of-data-products?ref=nadeemramli)

Luke Lin's Article Quote:
> In building this product (insights), you have to fully understand how the business works and how data can help identify and measure improvements To make data insights successful as a product, you need to understand the data fluency of your end users and how they consume data to run their business. Your analytics approach will vary based on your customers in order to optimize the impact of data insights for the business.

> In reality, what they need is a more structured approach for using data to run the business. Stakeholders today don’t fully understand how they can use data to make better decisions.

For example, most businesses use data to measure their user acquisition funnel. Your team might create several tables to identify the funnel steps and help your business partners to identify areas of improvement where they see increased drop-off. But there’s likely more insights that could be uncovered if you’re able to efficiently connect attributes and actions of unregistered users with the funnel metrics. 

By understanding what your business partners are trying to do (proactively identify areas of drop off and look for levers for growth), your data insights product can go beyond providing a simple funnel report and deliver more nuanced insights about which types of users drop off, where there could be more instrumentation to discover additional steps in a funnel, or how to predict dropoff before it happens so that the team can update the product flow itself.

> Going beyond what your stakeholders are asking and more deeply understanding the problems they’re trying to solve will help you develop a more robust and impactful data product.

Based of Luke's writing, I saw two parts that essentially important for decision maker to use data for. Proactively identify areas with gap for improvement, and looking levers for growth. 

Referring to my article [[Understanding Scope of Optimization]]. There are only few ways available for us to improve:

1. Do more or do less. 
2. Do better
