Excellent question. Modeling financial expenses correctly is the critical step that elevates your data stack from a _marketing analytics platform_ to a true _business intelligence engine_. Answering "How much did we sell?" is easy. Answering "How much did we _make_?" requires a robust expense model.

Let's break down the best way to model financial expenses for your e-commerce company, fitting it directly into your existing architecture.

### The Goal: Achieve "Contribution Margin" Visibility

Your ultimate goal is to calculate the **Contribution Margin** for every single order. The formula is:

**Contribution Margin = `Order Revenue` - `Variable Costs`**

This tells you how much profit each order _contributes_ to covering your fixed costs. To do this, you need to track two main categories of expenses:

1. **Variable Costs (Cost of Goods Sold - COGS):** Costs that scale directly with sales volume.
    
2. **Fixed Costs (Operating Expenses - OPEX):** Costs that remain relatively stable regardless of sales volume.
    

Here’s the best way to model them.

### Step 1: Identify and Source All Expenses

First, you need to categorize every dollar your business spends and identify the data source for each category.

| Expense Category                    | Specific Examples                                                                                                    | Data Source                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Product Costs (COGS)**            | • Cost of raw materials  <br>• Manufacturing costs  <br>• Inbound shipping to warehouse  <br>• Import duties/tariffs | **Your ERP, Accounting Software (QuickBooks, Xero), or a manual Google Sheet from your operations team.** |
| **Fulfillment Costs (COGS)**        | • Pick & pack fees (from your 3PL)  <br>• Packaging materials (boxes, tape)  <br>• Shipping costs to the customer    | **Shipping Provider (ShipStation, Shippo), 3PL provider reports, Shopify shipping data.**                 |
| **Transaction Fees (COGS)**         | • Shopify/WooCommerce transaction fees  <br>• Credit card processing fees (Stripe, PayPal)                           | **Shopify/Stripe/PayPal API or monthly statements.**                                                      |
| **Marketing Spend (OPEX)**          | • Ad spend (Meta, Google, TikTok)  <br>• Influencer fees  <br>• Agency retainers  <br>• SEO tools                    | You are already sourcing this from your "Acquisition" block.                                              |
| **Software & Subscriptions (OPEX)** | • Shopify/WooCommerce plan  <br>• Email marketing tools (Klaviyo)  <br>• Analytics tools (PostHog, etc.)             | **Accounting Software or manual tracking.**                                                               |
| **Salaries & Payroll (OPEX)**       | • Employee salaries  <br>• Contractor payments  <br>• Payroll taxes                                                  | **Accounting/Payroll Software (Gusto, Rippling).**                                                        |
| **Other G&A (OPEX)**                | • Rent, utilities  <br>• Legal, accounting services  <br>• Office supplies                                           | **Accounting Software.**                                                                                  |

### Step 2: Ingest and Model the Data in Your Warehouse

Now, let's fit this into your data pipeline (`Airbyte -> MotherDuck -> dbt`).

#### A. Modeling COGS (Variable Costs)

The key to COGS is to get it at the **SKU level**.

1. **Create a `stg_product_costs` Staging Model (in dbt):**
    - Ingest the raw product cost data from your ERP or accounting software via Airbyte.
    - This dbt model should clean the data to produce a table with the following columns: `sku`, `cost_of_goods`, `valid_from_date`, `valid_to_date`.
    - Why the date range? Because the cost of your products can change over time. This allows you to accurately apply the correct cost to an order based on when it was placed.
2. **Create a `stg_fulfillment_costs` Staging Model (in dbt):**
    - Ingest fulfillment and shipping data.
    - This can be tricky. A simple way is to use the _average shipping cost per order_ for a given period. A more advanced way is to get the actual shipping cost for _each specific order_ from your shipping provider's API.
3. Create a fct_order_profitability Mart Table (in dbt):
    This is the most important table. You will join your existing fct_sales table with your new COGS models.
    
    SQL
    
    ```
    -- Simplified dbt model for fct_order_profitability.sql
    SELECT
        sales.order_id,
        sales.order_created_at,
        sales.product_revenue,
        sales.shipping_revenue,
        sales.discounts,
        sales.order_total,
    
        -- Join to get the correct product cost for the date the order was placed
        product_costs.cost_of_goods,
    
        -- Get shipping and transaction costs
        fulfillment.actual_shipping_cost,
        sales.order_total * 0.029 + 0.30 AS estimated_transaction_fees, -- Example calculation
    
        -- Calculate Contribution Margin
        (sales.product_revenue - product_costs.cost_of_goods - fulfillment.actual_shipping_cost - estimated_transaction_fees) AS contribution_margin
    
    FROM {{ ref('fct_sales') }} AS sales
    LEFT JOIN {{ ref('stg_product_costs') }} AS product_costs
        ON sales.sku = product_costs.sku
        AND sales.order_created_at BETWEEN product_costs.valid_from_date AND product_costs.valid_to_date
    LEFT JOIN {{ ref('stg_fulfillment_costs') }} AS fulfillment
        ON sales.order_id = fulfillment.order_id
    ```
    

#### B. Modeling OPEX (Fixed Costs)

Fixed costs are generally not analyzed at the order level. Instead, they are modeled as a time-series to track overall business profitability.

1. **Create a `fct_daily_expenses` Mart Table (in dbt):**
    - Ingest your OPEX data from your accounting software.
    - This dbt model should aggregate all your fixed costs into a daily or monthly view.
    - **Columns:** `date`, `expense_category` (e.g., "Marketing", "Payroll"), `amount`.

### Step 3: From Data to Knowledge Base

Now you have these powerful new marts (`fct_order_profitability`, `fct_daily_expenses`). You can now feed them into your **Knowledge Base Generation** process to create artifacts that your RAG system can use.

- **New Knowledge Artifacts:**
    - **Profitability Summaries:** "Last week, our average contribution margin per order was $45.20."
    - **Product Profitability Analysis:** "The 'Premium Widget' is our most profitable product with a 75% margin, while the 'Basic Widget' is our least profitable at 20%."
    - **OPEX Alerts:** "Marketing spend increased by 15% this month, while overall revenue only grew by 5%. We need to investigate marketing efficiency."
    - **Break-Even Analysis:** "To cover our monthly fixed costs of $50,000, we need to generate at least $110,000 in total contribution margin."

By modeling your expenses in this structured way, you empower your AI agents to move beyond marketing questions and start providing true strategic business advice.
