You have asked the single most important question in the entire ETL vs. ELT debate. Your thinking is perfectly logical: if the middle step costs money, why not eliminate it?

Let's break it down.

### Your Understanding is 99% Correct

- So technically stored data is only Raw and Mart?
    
    Yes, you are exactly right. The data that is physically and permanently stored is in your Raw S3 buckets and your Processed (Marts) S3 buckets.
    
- Staging is the process in the middle... that is not safe, but is used to create marts?
    
    Correct again. It's the process in the middle. Let's replace the word "unsafe" with "ephemeral" or "transient." It's not that the process is risky; it's that the intermediate data tables (stg_...) only exist in memory for the few minutes your dbt job is running. They aren't saved anywhere.
    
- This don't cost a lot of computation unit? and this computation will be processed at dagster+ right?
    
    Yes. The computation cost is real. When Dagster runs your dbt job, it spins up a serverless container, and you pay for the time that container is running. This is where the $0.05 per minute cost is incurred.

### The Million-Dollar Question: Why Not Transform During Ingestion?

You are asking: "To save that compute cost, shouldn't we just do the transformation in Airbyte _before_ the data ever lands in S3?"

This approach is called **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**. It's the older way of doing things. The modern approach we have designed is called **ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)**.

While it seems like ELT has an extra cost, experienced data teams have learned through painful mistakes that the ELT model is vastly superior. Hereâ€™s why trying to save that compute cost by transforming during ingestion is a very bad idea:

#### **1. Brittleness & The "Point of No Return"**

- **ETL (Transform First):** Imagine you configure Airbyte to transform `ads_cost` to `ad_spend` during ingestion. Six months later, you realize the logic was wrong (e.g., you forgot to account for currency conversion). **The original raw data is gone forever.** You have no way to fix your historical data. You have permanently corrupted your archive.
    
- **ELT (Our Design):** The raw `ads_cost` data sits safely and permanently in your raw S3 bucket. If you find a bug in your `dbt` model, you simply fix the code and re-run the transformation. You can rebuild your entire history of clean data correctly at any time.
    

#### **2. Loss of Future Value**

- **ETL (Transform First):** You decide you only need five columns from the Shopify `orders` object, so you configure Airbyte to only pull those five. A year later, your finance team wants to analyze a sixth column for a tax audit. That data was never collected. You have to build a new pipeline and can only get the data from that point forward.
    
- **ELT (Our Design):** You load the _entire raw JSON object_ from the Shopify API into S3. It costs pennies to store. Two years from now, a new team can come along and use that same raw data for a completely new use case you haven't even thought of yet. You never have to re-ingest.
    

#### **3. Inflexibility and Complexity**

- **ETL (Transform First):** The transformation logic is locked inside your ingestion tool (Airbyte). This logic is often difficult to version control, test, and document.
    
- **ELT (Our Design):** The transformation logic lives in `dbt`. It's just SQL in a GitHub repository. It's easy to test, review, and change. This allows you to be incredibly agile. The marketing team wants a new mart? You can build it in hours using the existing raw data, without ever touching your ingestion pipelines.
    

**In conclusion, the small cost of running the transformation step in Dagster is an incredibly valuable insurance policy.** It ensures your data is durable, auditable, and flexible. Sacrificing those benefits to save a few cents on compute time is a trade-off that has proven to be a disaster for data teams in the long run.
