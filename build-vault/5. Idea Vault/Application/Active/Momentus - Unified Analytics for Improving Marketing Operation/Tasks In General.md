To build more value for my agency I am building a backend system called Momentus. My target market for this is SaaS and mainly E-Commerce.

Where it's product stand in 4 hierarchy.
1. Momentus Activate:
	1. (helps businesses instrument their tracking, event tracking strategy/planning, develop martech) it's a service work that helps client data activate.
2. Momentus Flow:
	1. (is a data architecture) that I've build to help my client who already activate, do more with their data. This whole architecture consist of ELT, Complex Transformation, and multi output (can RAG for them to talk to their data, and create agents on top of it), attribution, cohort analysis, get full growth operating report, forecast sales etc.
3. Momentus Operate:
	1. (is a reporting service) where I help clients create better roadmap to their success, this is based of data they have, which then I help them build their team, build their system, implement solutions, consultation etc.
4. Momentus Portal:
	1. (is a reporting interface) for all their data, embedded with LLM (they use their own API)
