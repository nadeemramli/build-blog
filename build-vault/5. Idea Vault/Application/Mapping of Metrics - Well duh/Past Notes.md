# Building my Own Mapping of Metrics

Third, This form connection is great, but I do however want the capability to add/edit and delete the metrics how I can I have this?

I also want to make sure there is data persistency, so all metrics can be save safely. Maybe we can use Django for this matter.

Fourth, how can I visualize the metrics map, the visualization should show the arrow of the metrics and the metrics attribution in a "card".
