So what are the Praxis?

Again, I want to recall our meaning in praxis, [[5. Idea Vault/Application/Through Praxis - A Simple Project Management/1. PD/1. PRD/PRD#^68d493|"emerging understanding and realization between tested theory/framework and learning experience from practical implementation"]].

In order for us to truly effective in building this app, we have to understand first, what are the useful tested theory/framework and how can we use that to lay the foundation of our approach, then deduce the approach by cutting things that we don't use when implement them in real life. Below is our process, our pattern that we use, every single time we "strategizing" our way. 

-----------
Praxis: Starting point: We usually have a long conversation deep diving around the problem. The trigger of such conversation usually started because of pain and problem, these pain and problem then trigger two mode of attempting to solve the problem, the first mode is reactive (we received feedback and potential improvement in real-time operation (during business operation) or we saw potential during optimization phase (course correction phase)), the second mode is proactive (we strategize for long-term improvement (preventing, branding, market share), or  expansion/taking risk for innovation). 

Theory: I think first we have to understand the type of the problem, reactive or proactive. If reactive, which part, if proactive, which part.  The reason why is this important is that, the pipeline of our approach is different. For type A1 problem, the approach would be direct, but with heavy documentation (opportunity mapping/prioritization/before change/after change/impact). For type A2, this required a "Doubleloop/CTC" approach. For type B1, this required "Playing to Win: Strategic approach", and lastly for B2 approach, this required "CRO/The Basics" approach.

Each approach have different models, objective, process and traits.

A simple mental models I love to use to navigate this step, is the 5-Step Process by Ray Dalio.

However, before I even proceed to set a clear goal, most of the time this is where the real problem even begin. The goal was not meaningful. 

The set goal either wrongfully track and attributed, or just plain wrong. Just like in Life, goals is a manifestation of our true dream/vision. However, goal is a layer before just that, this layer create a discrepancy between Goal =/= Dream. Most will pursue the goal as if it's pursuing their dream, until they realize that the goal doesn't serve them anymore, which then they cease to be effective.

This itself has a strong foundation/framework to think about, the model I constantly use to navigate these are these models:

1. Lenny's Pyramid:
	1. Concept: ![[Pasted image 20250218051622.png]]
	2. Example: ![[Pasted image 20250218051647.png]]



So fundamentally the app need:
1. Entity Name
	1. Child under Entity:
		1. Vision and Mission statement) : How do we know we are successful?
		2. Accounting
			1. If we take salary
			2. If we take equity
			3. If it's our business
			4. How much we get from this endeavor
			5. What's the stake here?
			6. What's the plan to get the work here done? Is this our end game?
			7. Maybe can store document for the balance sheet etc?
2. Entity Metrics Framework : Manifestation of the Entity in a Quantitative Matter
	1. North Star Framework
	2. OKRs, KPI Trees
	3. React Flow, then Cards as a way to manage components inside the react flow:
		1. Your cards include your bets, objectives, any other type of card you create outside of work, metrics, and maps. 
		2. Card Detail: Tick, Name, Type, Filter based of maps, Source and Data Points
3. Project Name
4. 
5. What's our Strategy to achieve that?
