Neutral or Mixed Role Muscle Groups

These muscles don’t strictly fall into push or pull categories, as they often stabilize or assist in both types of movements:

- Core:
    
    - Rectus Abdominis: Stabilizes the torso in both push (e.g., planks) and pull (e.g., hanging leg raises).
        
    - Transversus Abdominis: Core stability for all lifts.
        
    - Obliques (External and Internal): Stabilize and rotate during both push and pull exercises.
        
    - Quadratus Lumborum: Stabilizes the lower back in both categories.
        
- Hip Flexors (Iliopsoas): Flexes the hip, used in pulling the legs up (e.g., leg raises) but also stabilizes in squats (push).
    
- Tensor Fasciae Latae: Stabilizes the hip and knee in both push and pull movements.
    
- Forearm Extensors: Assist in grip and wrist stability for both push (e.g., pressing) and pull (e.g., rows).
    
- Plantaris: Minor role in plantarflexion, assists in both push and pull lower-body movements.

Summary

- Push: Focuses on chest, triceps, anterior delts, quads, and calves—think pressing and extending.
    
- Pull: Focuses on back, biceps, posterior delts, hamstrings, and adductors—think rowing and flexing.
    
- Neutral: Core and stabilizers that support both.
