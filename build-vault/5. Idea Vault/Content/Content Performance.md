You're absolutely correct—different niches and video lengths can significantly impact monetization on YouTube, particularly through AdSense revenue. Let’s break this down based on the discussion and general knowledge about YouTube monetization, and I’ll explain other factors that could influence earnings and how to forecast them.

### 1. **Different Niches Have Different CPMs (Cost Per Mille)**
   - **CPM Variation by Niche**: The Cost Per Mille (CPM), or the amount advertisers pay per 1,000 views, varies widely depending on the niche. Niches with high commercial intent or affluent audiences (e.g., finance, technology, luxury products) tend to have higher CPMs because advertisers are willing to pay more to reach those viewers. In contrast, niches like British basketball (as mentioned in the tweet) might have a lower CPM if the audience is smaller or less lucrative for advertisers.
   - **Example**: Gaming or entertainment niches often have lower CPMs (e.g., $0.25–$2), while finance or health-related niches can have CPMs ranging from $5–$20 or more, depending on the region and audience demographics.
   - **Why It Matters**: Paddy Galloway’s response about calculating the Total Addressable Market (TAM) and studying top performers is a great strategy to estimate the niche’s potential. You’d need to research the average CPM for British basketball or similar sports niches to gauge revenue potential.

### 2. **Video Length and Monetization**
   - **Long-Form vs. Short-Form Content**: Gabriel Licona’s follow-up question about “1M long-form views” being correct ties into Paddy’s estimate of needing around 1 million views per month to hit £5–10k. Long-form content (typically videos over 10 minutes) generally allows for more ad breaks, increasing potential ad revenue. YouTube’s monetization policies often favor longer videos because they can host multiple mid-roll ads.
   - **Short-Form Content**: Shorts (less than 1 minute) have a different monetization model, often based on a share of ad revenue or the YouTube Shorts Fund, with lower per-view earnings but potentially higher viewership volume.
   - **Impact**: Longer videos can generate more revenue per view if they retain audience attention and include skippable or non-skippable ads, but they require higher production quality and engagement to succeed.

### 3. **Other Factors Influencing Monetization**
   Beyond niches and video length, several other factors affect YouTube AdSense revenue:
   - **Audience Geography**: Viewers in regions with higher ad rates (e.g., the US, UK, Canada, Australia) generate more revenue per view than those in lower-CPM regions (e.g., India, Southeast Asia). British basketball viewers might be concentrated in the UK, which has a relatively high CPM, but if the audience is global, the average CPM could drop.
   - **Engagement Metrics**: Watch time, likes, comments, and shares signal to YouTube that your content is valuable, which can increase ad placements and CPM. High retention rates (viewers watching most of the video) are particularly important.
   - **Ad Type and Frequency**: Skippable vs. non-skippable ads, pre-roll vs. mid-roll ads, and the number of ads per video all impact earnings. YouTube dynamically adjusts ad frequency based on viewer behavior and niche.
   - **Seasonality and Trends**: Revenue can fluctuate based on the time of year (e.g., holidays may boost ad spending) or trending topics within your niche.
   - **Content Quality and Production Value**: High-quality videos with good editing, visuals, and audio can attract more views and higher-paying advertisers.
   - **Competition**: If the niche is oversaturated with creators, it might drive down CPMs due to increased supply of ad inventory.

### 4. **How to Forecast YouTube Monetization**
   Forecasting AdSense revenue involves estimating several variables. Here’s a step-by-step approach:
   - **Estimate Views**: Based on your niche, target audience, and content strategy, predict how many views you can realistically achieve per month. Paddy’s estimate of 1 million views for £5–10k suggests a CPM range of £5–10 ($6.50–$13 USD, roughly, depending on exchange rates as of March 2025).
   - **Determine Average CPM**: Research the average CPM for your niche. Use tools like Social Blade, TubeBuddy, or industry reports to find benchmarks. For British basketball, you might find it’s lower than mainstream sports like football (soccer) or American basketball, but higher than ultra-niche topics.
   - **Calculate Revenue**: Use the formula:  
     \[
     \text{Revenue} = \text{Views} \div 1,000 \times \text{CPM}
     \]
     For example, if you get 1 million views and the CPM is £5, your revenue would be £5,000.
   - **Adjust for Variables**: Factor in audience location, engagement, video length, and ad frequency. Use historical data from your channel or similar channels to refine your estimates.
   - **Monitor and Iterate**: YouTube monetization data is dynamic, so regularly check your YouTube Analytics to track actual CPM, RPM (Revenue Per Mille), and other metrics. Adjust your strategy based on performance.

### 5. **Additional Tips for British Basketball or Similar Niches**
   - If British basketball is too niche, consider expanding to related areas like European basketball, sports training, or athlete interviews to broaden your audience and potentially increase CPM.
   - Collaborate with other creators or leverage partnerships with basketball organizations in the UK to boost visibility and ad revenue.
   - Focus on creating engaging, long-form content (e.g., match analyses, player profiles, or training tips) to maximize ad opportunities.

If you’d like more precise data or real-time insights (e.g., current CPMs for specific niches), I can offer to search the web or analyze additional content for you. Would you like me to do that? Otherwise, I hope this breakdown helps you understand and forecast your monetization strategy!


Based on your specific goals and the example you provided, here’s a detailed strategy and set of metrics for a content creator from Malaysia to achieve at least $5,000 USD in monthly revenue from YouTube, focusing on 10-minute-plus videos in high-CPM niches like technology and finance (or other lucrative niches). I’ll also consider the viewership scenarios you outlined (5–6 videos/month with 166,666 views each, or 15 videos/month with 66,666 views each) and provide additional factors to optimize for success. This analysis draws on general knowledge about YouTube monetization and trends as of March 2025, tailored to your context.

### **1. Understanding the Goal: $5,000 USD Monthly Revenue**
To achieve $5,000 USD per month, we need to estimate the required Revenue Per Mille (RPM) or Cost Per Mille (CPM) based on your viewership scenarios. RPM is what you earn per 1,000 views, while CPM is what advertisers pay per 1,000 ad impressions (YouTube takes a 45% cut, so RPM is typically lower than CPM).

- **Average YouTube CPM in 2025**: Based on recent data, the global average CPM is around $15.34 USD, but it can vary significantly by niche, country, and audience. For high-CPM niches like technology, finance, digital marketing, or insurance, CPMs can range from $20–$50 USD or higher, especially if targeting viewers in high-paying countries (e.g., US, Canada, Australia, UK). For Malaysia, the CPM might be lower (around $5–$10 USD) due to regional ad rates, but targeting international audiences can boost earnings.
- **RPM Calculation**: If YouTube takes 45%, your RPM would be approximately 55% of the CPM. For a $30 CPM (a reasonable target for tech/finance), your RPM would be around $16.50 USD per 1,000 views.

#### **Scenario 1: 5–6 Videos/Month, 166,666 Views/Video**
- Total monthly views: 5 videos × 166,666 views = 833,333 views, or 6 videos × 166,666 views = 1,000,000 views.
- To earn $5,000 USD, you’d need an RPM of:
  - For 833,333 views: $5,000 ÷ (833,333 ÷ 1,000) = $6.00 RPM.
  - For 1,000,000 views: $5,000 ÷ (1,000,000 ÷ 1,000) = $5.00 RPM.
- This RPM is achievable in high-CPM niches (e.g., tech/finance) if targeting viewers in high-paying regions, but it’s on the lower end. You’d likely need a CPM of $10–$12 USD (RPM of $5.50–$6.60) to hit this, which is realistic for Malaysia if you optimize for international audiences.

#### **Scenario 2: 15 Videos/Month, 66,666 Views/Video**
- Total monthly views: 15 videos × 66,666 views = 1,000,000 views.
- To earn $5,000 USD: $5,000 ÷ (1,000,000 ÷ 1,000) = $5.00 RPM, requiring a CPM of around $9–$10 USD (RPM of $5.00), which is also feasible in high-CPM niches with international targeting.

Both scenarios require targeting high-CPM niches and optimizing for viewer location and engagement to achieve the necessary RPM.

### **2. High-CPM Niches to Focus On**
Here’s a list of niches with historically higher CPMs (based on 2025 trends), which are relevant for a Malaysian content creator aiming for $5,000 USD/month. These niches attract advertisers willing to pay more due to high buyer intent or affluent audiences:

- **Technology**: Covers software reviews, gadget unboxings, tech tutorials (e.g., AI, blockchain, cybersecurity). CPM can range from $20–$50 USD, especially for B2B or enterprise tech content targeting the US, Europe, or Australia.
- **Finance**: Includes personal finance tips, investment strategies, cryptocurrency, stock market analysis, or financial planning. CPM can reach $20–$40 USD, particularly for content appealing to high-income audiences in North America or Europe.
- **Digital Marketing**: Focuses on SEO, social media marketing, email marketing, or ad strategies. CPM often ranges from $15–$30 USD, with strong advertiser demand from businesses.
- **Insurance**: Content about insurance products, comparisons, or financial security. CPM can be $20–$35 USD due to high-value clients.
- **Health & Wellness**: High-demand topics like mental health, fitness, or premium health products. CPM can range from $15–$25 USD, especially with international viewers.
- **Real Estate**: Covers property investment, home buying tips, or luxury real estate. CPM can be $15–$30 USD, targeting affluent audiences.
- **Education**: Tutorials, online courses, or professional development (e.g., coding, data science). CPM ranges from $15–$25 USD, with strong advertiser interest in professional audiences.
- **Luxury Products**: Reviews or guides on luxury goods (watches, cars, fashion). CPM can be $20–$40 USD, but requires targeting premium markets.

For Malaysia, you can create content in these niches but optimize for English-speaking international audiences (e.g., US, UK, Canada, Australia) to maximize CPM, as these regions have higher ad rates (e.g., US CPM averages $15.34–$32.75 USD, UK $21.59 USD, Australia $36.21 USD).

### **3. Strategy to Achieve $5,000 USD Monthly Revenue**
Here’s a comprehensive strategy tailored to your goals, location, and video format (10+ minutes):

#### **Content Creation**
- **Focus on High-CPM Niches**: Prioritize technology, finance, or digital marketing, as these niches have strong advertiser demand and higher CPMs. Create in-depth, 10+ minute videos (e.g., tech tutorials, finance investment guides) to allow mid-roll ads, boosting revenue potential.
- **Target International Audiences**: Since Malaysia’s local CPM is lower, produce English-language content or add subtitles to appeal to viewers in high-CPM countries (US, UK, Canada, Australia). Use culturally relevant examples but ensure global accessibility.
- **Optimize Video Length**: Stick to 10+ minute videos to enable mid-roll ads, which increase revenue. Ensure content remains engaging to maintain watch time (aim for 70%+ retention).
- **High-Quality Production**: Invest in good audio, visuals, and editing to attract advertisers and retain viewers. High-value content commands higher CPMs.
- **Consistency**: Post 5–6 or 15 videos monthly (depending on your scenario) on a consistent schedule (e.g., weekly or bi-weekly) to build an audience and maintain algorithm favor.

#### **Audience Engagement**
- **Boost Watch Time and Retention**: Use compelling hooks, clear structures, and calls-to-action to keep viewers watching. High retention signals quality to YouTube, increasing ad placements and CPM.
- **Encourage Interaction**: Prompt viewers to like, comment, and share to improve engagement metrics, which can indirectly boost ad revenue.
- **Build a Subscriber Base**: Aim for a loyal subscriber base (e.g., 50,000+ subscribers) to unlock more monetization features and increase views per video.

#### **Monetization Optimization**
- **Enable All Ad Formats**: Use skippable, non-skippable, and display ads to maximize revenue. Non-skippable ads typically have higher CPMs.
- **Explore Additional Revenue Streams**: Beyond AdSense, consider YouTube Premium revenue, channel memberships, Super Chat (for live streams), and affiliate marketing (e.g., promoting tech/finance products with affiliate links).
- **Target High-CPM Regions**: Use YouTube Analytics to identify where your viewers are located. If most views come from low-CPM regions (e.g., Southeast Asia), adjust content or marketing to attract high-CPM audiences.

#### **SEO and Discovery**
- **Optimize Metadata**: Use keyword research tools (e.g., TubeBuddy, VidIQ) to identify high-traffic, high-CPM keywords in your niche (e.g., “best AI tools 2025,” “crypto investment tips”). Include these in titles, descriptions, and tags.
- **Thumbnails and Titles**: Create eye-catching thumbnails and compelling titles to increase click-through rates (aim for 5–10% CTR).
- **Collaborate with Other Creators**: Partner with Malaysian or international creators in tech/finance niches to cross-promote and expand your reach.

#### **Analytics and Iteration**
- **Track Key Metrics**: Use YouTube Analytics to monitor:
  - **Views**: Ensure you’re hitting 833,333–1,000,000 views/month.
  - **RPM/CPM**: Track your actual RPM to ensure it’s at least $5.00–$6.00 to hit $5,000 USD.
  - **Audience Retention**: Aim for 70%+ retention to qualify for more ad placements.
  - **Viewer Location**: Shift strategies if most views come from low-CPM regions.
  - **Engagement (Likes, Comments, Shares)**: Higher engagement can indirectly boost CPM.
- **Adjust Based on Data**: If RPM/CPM is too low, refine content, target higher-CPM niches, or focus on international audiences.

### **4. Additional Metrics to Monitor**
Beyond views and RPM, track these metrics to ensure you’re on track for $5,000 USD/month:

- **Average Watch Time**: Aim for 70%+ retention on 10-minute videos to maximize ad opportunities.
- **Click-Through Rate (CTR)**: Target 5–10% to ensure videos are discoverable and attractive to viewers.
- **Impressions**: High impressions with low CTR may indicate unappealing thumbnails/titles—optimize these.
- **Subscriber Growth**: Building a subscriber base (e.g., 50,000+) unlocks more monetization features and stabilizes viewership.
- **Ad Revenue Breakdown**: Analyze which ad types (skippable, non-skippable) and regions drive the most revenue.
- **Seasonality**: Expect higher CPMs during peak ad seasons (e.g., holidays, Q4 2025), but plan for dips in other months.

### **5. Challenges and Considerations for Malaysia**
- **Lower Local CPM**: Malaysia’s CPM is typically lower ($5–$10 USD) than global averages. To hit $5,000 USD, you’ll need to target international audiences or diversify revenue streams (e.g., affiliate marketing, sponsorships).
- **Internet Penetration and Audience**: Malaysia has strong internet access, but competition in English-language tech/finance content may be high. Focus on niche subtopics (e.g., Malaysian perspectives on global tech trends) to stand out.
- **Language Barrier**: Creating English content or adding subtitles can widen your audience, but ensure content resonates with both local and international viewers.

---

### **6. Example Forecast**
Let’s assume you target a $30 USD CPM (tech/finance niche, international audience), resulting in an RPM of $16.50 USD:
- **Scenario 1 (5 videos, 166,666 views each)**: 833,333 views × $16.50 RPM = $13,750 USD/month (well above $5,000 USD).
- **Scenario 2 (15 videos, 66,666 views each)**: 1,000,000 views × $16.50 RPM = $16,500 USD/month (also above $5,000 USD).

If your actual CPM is lower (e.g., $15 USD, RPM $8.25), you’d still earn:
- Scenario 1: 833,333 views × $8.25 = $6,875 USD/month.
- Scenario 2: 1,000,000 views × $8.25 = $8,250 USD/month.

Both scenarios exceed $5,000 USD if you optimize for high-CPM niches and audiences, but you’ll need to monitor and adjust if CPMs drop due to regional viewership or ad demand.

### **7. What Else Can Help?**
- **Diversify Income**: Beyond ads, explore affiliate marketing (e.g., promoting tech gadgets, financial tools), sponsorships from Malaysian or international brands, or selling digital products (e.g., eBooks on finance/tech tips).
- **Live Streaming**: Use Super Chat during live tech/finance Q&As to earn additional revenue from engaged viewers.
- **Community Building**: Offer channel memberships or merchandise (e.g., branded tech/finance guides) to loyal subscribers.
- **Seasonal Campaigns**: Capitalize on high-CPM periods (e.g., Black Friday, year-end holidays) with timely tech/finance content (e.g., “Best Tech Gifts 2025,” “Year-End Investment Strategies”).

By combining high-CPM niches, international targeting, and consistent, engaging 10+ minute videos, you can achieve and exceed your $5,000 USD monthly revenue goal as a Malaysian content creator.
