1. Question:
	1. **Based of this, if we running an ecommerce F&B business,** 
	   **That is aiming for RM135,000/monthly sales, and also equivalent of RM5,000/daily sales, which around 300-350 unit sold or around 200 orders since our average basket size is 2 unit per order, with equivalent of RM16/per unit price.** 
	   **How much contribution sales for this based of the user segment? New user, owned audience, vs. repeat order?**
2. Answer:
	1. Let me help break down the sales distribution across different user segments based on the layer cake metaphor and typical e-commerce patterns.

For an F&B e-commerce business with your metrics:
- Monthly target: RM135,000
- Daily target: RM5,000
- Units per day: 300-350
- Orders per day: ~200
- Average basket size: 2 units
- Unit price: RM16

A typical healthy distribution would look like this:

1. Existing Customers (Bottom Layer - Most Stable):
- Should contribute about 50-55% of revenue
- Monthly contribution: ~RM70,000-74,250
- These are your repeat customers with proven LTV

1. Owned Audiences (Middle Layer):
- Should contribute about 30-35% of revenue
- Monthly contribution: ~RM40,500-47,250
- This comes from email marketing, SMS campaigns, organic social followers, and organic search
- Lower acquisition cost since you already have their attention

1. Paid Acquisition (Top Layer - Most Variable):
- Should contribute about 15-20% of revenue
- Monthly contribution: ~RM20,250-27,000
- New customers acquired through paid channels
- Highest acquisition cost but necessary for growth

This distribution ensures:
- Sustainable growth with controlled acquisition costs
- Strong foundation from repeat customers
- Effective utilization of owned channels
- Reasonable dependence on paid acquisition

Would you like me to break down specific strategies for growing any of these segments?
Provided that based of data, existing customer contribute to 20-30% repeat rate.

Ah, this changes the distribution significantly. Let me recalculate based on your actual repeat customer rate of 20-30%.

For your monthly target of RM135,000:

1. Existing Customers (20-30% repeat rate):
- Monthly contribution: RM27,000-40,500
- Daily sales: RM1,000-1,500
- Daily orders: ~40-60 orders

1. Owned Audiences (recommended 40-45%):
- Monthly contribution: RM54,000-60,750
- Daily sales: RM2,000-2,250
- Daily orders: ~80-90 orders
- This becomes crucial since repeat rate is lower
- Focus channels: Email, SMS, organic social, search

1. Paid Acquisition (remaining 30-35%):
- Monthly contribution: RM40,500-47,250
- Daily sales: RM1,500-1,750
- Daily orders: ~60-70 orders
- Higher than ideal due to lower repeat rate

Key Observations:
1. Your repeat rate is lower than the ideal 50-55%, which means:
   - Higher customer acquisition costs needed
   - More pressure on marketing to find new customers
   - Greater importance of owned media channels

2. Recommendations:
   - Investigate why repeat rate is only 20-30%
   - Focus on customer retention strategies
   - Strong loyalty program might help
   - Consider subscription models if suitable for your F&B products
   - Invest in customer service and product quality to increase repeat purchases

For owned audience, we're don't pay for new customer, so for our aCAC for new customer would be RM5-10, how much do we hve to spend for marketing?

Let me help calculate your marketing budget based on the customer acquisition cost (aCAC) of RM5-10 per new customer.

From your earlier numbers:
- Monthly sales target: RM135,000
- About 30-35% should come from new paid customers
- That's approximately RM40,500-47,250 from new customers

Let's calculate:
1. Average order value (AOV):
- 2 units per order × RM16 per unit = RM32 per order

1. Number of new customers needed monthly:
- New customer revenue: RM40,500-47,250
- Divided by AOV (RM32)
- = 1,265 to 1,477 new customers needed monthly

1. Marketing spend calculation:
- At RM5 aCAC: 
  - 1,265 customers × RM5 = RM6,325
  - 1,477 customers × RM5 = RM7,385

- At RM10 aCAC:
  - 1,265 customers × RM10 = RM12,650
  - 1,477 customers × RM10 = RM14,770

Therefore, your monthly marketing budget for paid acquisition should be:
- Minimum: RM6,325
- Maximum: RM14,770
- Average recommended budget: RM10,500

This represents about 7-11% of your monthly revenue target, which is within healthy margins for F&B e-commerce.

Would you like to explore how to optimize this budget across different marketing channels?
