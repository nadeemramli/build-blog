Customer
1. Promotional Tools: They need to create discounts and track their effectiveness. Maybe integrating with the front-end to apply promo codes and track which promotions lead to sales. But how do they want to use this data? Maybe to learn which promotions work best, so analytics would be important here.
2. CRM: Managing customer data, like contact info, order history, preferences. Exporting data for SMS/WhatsApp blasts. But they need to be careful with data privacy laws. Also, segmenting customers based on purchase behavior could help target promotions better.
3. Maybe reporting/analytics to see sales trends, popular items, peak times. Also, customer feedback collection to improve service. A dashboard for the owner to see everything at a glance.
4. Multi-channel sales. If they sell on other platforms (like Facebook, Instagram), integrating those into the back-end to centralize orders. Manual upload?
5. Loyalty programs. Track customer points or rewards to encourage repeat purchases.
6. Data export/import. Being able to export customer lists, order histories, etc., in standard formats like CSV.

Operation
1. Order Management: Similar to Domino’s tracker. So real-time order tracking for customers, but also for the business owner to manage orders, maybe assign delivery routes, update statuses. Integration with the front-end to show customers estimated delivery times based on their location.
2. Route Planning: Optimize delivery routes to save time and fuel. Maybe integrate with a mapping service like Google Maps API. Assign drivers, track deliveries in real-time. But for a small team, it needs to be simple. Maybe just optimizing the order of deliveries based on locations.
3. Localization. If the business operates in multiple districts, the system should handle different delivery zones, maybe different pricing or delivery times per zone.
4. What about returns or cancellations? How to handle those in the order management system. Refunds processing if they’re using online payments.

Product
1. Inventory Management: Track ingredients or products, get alerts when stock is low. Maybe integrate with order management to deduct inventory when orders are placed. Should also handle batch production planning if they make items in batches.
2. Also, notifications. The owner should get alerts for new orders, low inventory, delivery updates. Customers might want SMS/email notifications about their order status.



Technical
1. Scalability is a consideration. As the business grows, the system should handle more orders and data without crashing.
2. User roles and permissions. If there are multiple team members, the owner might want to restrict access to certain features.
3. Testing the system thoroughly before launch. Maybe a staging environment to test updates without affecting the live site.
4. Backup and recovery. Regular automated backups to prevent data loss.

So maybe batch orders by district and schedule delivery days accordingly. The system could automatically group orders by location and suggest the optimal delivery day and route.

Also, production planning. If they know how many orders are coming from each district, they can plan how much to produce each day. The inventory management could tie into this by tracking ingredient usage based on orders.

Analytics could show which districts are most profitable, which items sell best where, helping them focus their marketing efforts.

Maybe a calendar view in the back-end to visualize delivery schedules, production batches, and promotions.


Error handling and logging. If something goes wrong, the system should log errors for debugging.

Mobile app for the owner? Maybe a mobile-responsive web app instead of a native app to save development time and cost.

Payment gateway integration. Ensuring that payments are processed securely, handling failed transactions, and reconciling payments with orders.

Content management for the front-end, like updating menus

Order customization. Allowing customers to add special instructions, which the back-end needs to track and display to the production team.

Time slots for delivery. Letting customers choose a delivery window, which the back-end uses to plan routes.

Wait, the user mentioned pre-orders and COD. So the payment system needs to handle different payment methods, track COD orders, and maybe mark them as paid upon delivery.

Reporting for financials, like daily sales, expenses, profit margins.

Loyalty programs where customers earn points per purchase, redeemable for discounts.

Referral tracking to see which customers bring in new business.

Inventory alerts when stock is low, and maybe auto-generate purchase orders for suppliers.

Batch tracking for ingredients, especially important for food businesses to manage expiry dates.

Supplier management, tracking contact info, order histories, lead times.

Customer reviews and ratings, integrated into the back-end to monitor feedback. Manual kick-in

Data export for external analysis. Letting the owner export sales data to Excel for further processing.

Customizable reports where the owner can choose metrics and time frames.

Automated emails for order confirmations, shipping updates, etc.

A dashboard that shows key metrics at a glance: daily orders, revenue, popular items, delivery statuses.

Offline functionality, in case the internet goes down, the owner can still take orders or manage inventory.

Multi-user collaboration, allowing team members to work simultaneously without conflicts.

Disaster recovery plan, in case of server failure or data breaches.

Compliance with food safety regulations, if applicable, like tracking ingredient sources.

Recipe management, if they make products from recipes, tracking ingredients needed per item.

Waste tracking to monitor unsold items and adjust production accordingly.

Gift cards or voucher system for customers to purchase.

Predictive analytics to forecast demand based on historical data, helping with production planning.

Real-time inventory updates to prevent overselling.

A returns and refunds management system to handle customer complaints.

Performance metrics for delivery drivers, like on-time delivery rates.

Customer lifetime value tracking to identify high-value customers.
