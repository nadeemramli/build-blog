You’re piecing together a solid framework for understanding costing and profit, so let’s refine it and make sure it all lines up. I’ll walk through your structure, clarify terms, and tie it to how businesses typically calculate gross profit and beyond. Here’s how it shakes out based on what you’ve described:

Step 1: Product Costs and Initial Gross Profit

You’re right to start with the cost to produce a product—let’s call these direct product costs. These are things like raw materials, production labor, and anything else directly tied to making the product. In accounting, this is often called Cost of Goods Sold (COGS).

- Revenue - Direct Product Costs (COGS) = Gross Profit  
    This is the basic gross profit, showing how much you make from sales after covering just the direct costs of production. It’s a rough measure of profitability before other expenses.
    

Step 2: Variable Costs (Marketing, Delivery, etc.)

You mentioned subtracting costs like marketing and cost of delivery (COD)—which you’re bundling as variable costs that scale with sales. This includes transaction fees, email marketing, and broader marketing spending (excluding stuff like domains, which you’ve correctly pegged as overhead). These are often called variable selling costs or cost of sales in some setups.

- Revenue - (Direct Product Costs + Variable Selling Costs) = Contribution Margin (or a “Cleaner” Gross Profit)  
    Here’s where it gets nuanced. If you subtract both the direct product costs and these variable costs (like marketing and delivery) from revenue, you’re not quite at traditional gross profit anymore. This is closer to a contribution margin—a measure of how much each sale contributes to covering fixed costs and profit after all variable costs are paid. It’s “cleaner” in the sense that it strips out more expenses tied to sales volume, leaving you with a clearer view of what’s left to handle fixed costs.
    

Traditional gross profit usually stops at COGS (direct product costs), while marketing and delivery might fall under operating expenses later. But your approach—bundling them as variable costs—works if you want a tighter grip on profitability per sale. It’s just a matter of labeling.

Step 3: Subtracting Fixed Costs (Overhead, Finance, etc.)

After your “cleaner” profit (or contribution margin), you subtract the costs to run the business day-to-day. You’ve split these into Overhead and Finance, which makes sense. Let’s break them down:

Overhead (Day-to-Day Operating Costs)

These are the fixed or semi-fixed costs to keep the business running, not tied to sales volume:

- Rent: Definitely overhead—classic fixed cost.
    
- Fixed Labor: Salaries for admin, management, or non-production staff (production labor would be in COGS). This fits under overhead too.
    
- Other Overhead: Domains, software subscriptions, utilities—stuff you’ve already flagged as overhead earlier.
    

Finance (Capital and Funding Costs)

These are costs tied to investments or financing, not daily operations:

- CapEx (Capital Expenditures): Buying machines, expansion costs—big one-time purchases. These don’t hit profit directly; they’re capitalized and depreciated over time, with depreciation showing up as overhead.
    
- Debt/Interest: Interest on loans or debt, which you’ve correctly separated from overhead. It’s a financing cost, deducted later in the profit calculation.
    
- Expansion: If this means more CapEx (like new equipment), it’s here. If it’s ongoing costs from expansion (like higher rent), it might shift to overhead.
    

Putting It Together

Here’s how it flows:

1. Revenue - Direct Product Costs (COGS) = Basic Gross Profit
    
2. Basic Gross Profit - Variable Selling Costs (Marketing, Delivery, etc.) = Contribution Margin (your “cleaner” gross profit)
    
3. Contribution Margin - Overhead (Rent, Fixed Labor, etc.) = Operating Profit (or EBIT: Earnings Before Interest and Taxes)
    
4. Operating Profit - Interest = Net Profit Before Taxes (then subtract taxes for final net profit)
    

CapEx doesn’t directly subtract here—it’s an investment, not an expense. Its impact shows up through depreciation (in overhead) over time.

Does This Match Your Thinking?

Your structure is spot-on for tracking variable vs. fixed costs, and it’s practical for decision-making—like seeing how much marketing spend scales with sales. The “cleaner” gross profit you’re describing is essentially contribution margin, which is super useful for businesses with high variable costs. If you’re expanding, you’d factor in new overhead (e.g., more rent or labor) and depreciation from CapEx, while keeping interest separate.
