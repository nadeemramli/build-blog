SEO Checklist for Your E-Commerce Website

1. On-Page SEO

These steps optimize individual pages to rank higher and attract relevant visitors.

- Keyword Research
    
    - Identify primary keywords (e.g., “ice cream cake delivery,” “milky drinks near me”) using tools like Google Keyword Planner, Ahrefs, or Ubersuggest.
        
    - Target long-tail keywords (e.g., “best chocolate ice cream cake in [location]”) for less competition and higher intent.
        
    - Assign keywords to each page (e.g., “/ice-cream-cake” → “custom ice cream cakes”).
        
- Optimize Page Titles
    
    - Keep titles under 60 characters, unique, and keyword-rich (e.g., “Order Custom Ice Cream Cakes | [Brand Name]”).
        
    - Use Next.js <Head> component to set dynamic titles per page.
        
- Craft Meta Descriptions
    
    - Write compelling, keyword-inclusive descriptions under 160 characters (e.g., “Delicious ice cream cakes delivered fresh. Order now at [Brand Name]!”).
        
    - Add to each page via <Head> in Next.js.
        
- Use Heading Tags (H1, H2, H3)
    
    - Ensure every page has one H1 tag with the primary keyword (e.g., “Our Ice Cream Cakes” on “/ice-cream-cake”).
        
    - Use H2/H3 for subtopics (e.g., “Flavors,” “Order Process”).
        
- Optimize URLs
    
    - Keep them short, descriptive, and keyword-focused (e.g., “/products/ice-cream-cake” instead of “/prod?id=123”).
        
    - Leverage Next.js routing for clean slugs.
        
- Image Optimization
    
    - Use descriptive file names (e.g., “chocolate-ice-cream-cake.jpg” instead of “img1.jpg”).
        
    - Add alt text (e.g., “Chocolate ice cream cake with sprinkles”) for accessibility and SEO.
        
    - Compress images (e.g., with next/image) to boost load speed.
        
- Internal Linking
    
    - Link related pages (e.g., “/ice-cream-cake” to “/pickup-and-delivery” or “/blog” posts about cake recipes).
        
    - Use descriptive anchor text (e.g., “Explore our milky drinks” instead of “click here”).
        
- Schema Markup
    
    - Add structured data (e.g., Product, Breadcrumb, FAQ schemas) using JSON-LD in Next.js.
        
    - Example: Mark up “/ice-cream-cake” with price, availability, and reviews for rich snippets.
        

1. Technical SEO

This ensures search engines can crawl, index, and rank your site effectively.

- Fast Loading Speed
    
    - Use Next.js features like Image Optimization and Static Site Generation (SSG) for key pages (e.g., “/home,” “/products”).
        
    - Test with Google PageSpeed Insights—aim for scores above 90.
        
- Mobile Responsiveness
    
    - Design with a mobile-first approach (Next.js makes this easy with CSS-in-JS or frameworks like Tailwind).
        
    - Test with Google’s Mobile-Friendly Test.
        
- XML Sitemap
    
    - Generate a sitemap (e.g., “/sitemap.xml”) including all pages (use next-sitemap package).
        
    - Submit it to Google Search Console.
        
- Robots.txt
    
    - Create a “/robots.txt” file to guide crawlers (e.g., allow “/products,” disallow “/form”).
        
    - Host it at your root with Next.js public folder.
        
- Canonical Tags
    
    - Add canonical tags to avoid duplicate content (e.g., if “/browse-menu” and “/products” overlap).
        
    - Set in <Head> (e.g., <link rel="canonical" href="https://yourdomain.com/products" />).
        
- HTTPS
    
    - Ensure your site uses HTTPS (set up via hosting provider like Vercel).
        
    - Redirect HTTP to HTTPS.
        
- 404 and Error Handling
    
    - Customize your 404 page (already in your list) with links to key pages (e.g., “/home,” “/products”).
        
    - Monitor broken links with tools like Screaming Frog.
        
- Crawlability
    
    - Avoid blocking CSS/JS files in “/robots.txt” that affect rendering (Next.js handles this well by default).
        
    - Check crawl errors in Google Search Console.
        

1. Content SEO

Content drives engagement and signals relevance to search engines.

- Product Descriptions
    
    - Write unique, keyword-rich descriptions for each item on “/ice-cream-cake” and “/milky-drinks” (e.g., “Indulge in our creamy vanilla ice cream cake, perfect for birthdays”).
        
    - Avoid duplicate or thin content.
        
- Blog Strategy
    
    - Publish regular posts on “/blog” targeting keywords (e.g., “How to Store Ice Cream Cakes” or “Top 5 Milky Drink Recipes”).
        
    - Aim for 800–1500 words per post with internal links to product pages.
        
- Local SEO (if applicable)
    
    - Add location-specific keywords (e.g., “ice cream cakes [city]”) to “/home,” “/location,” and “/pickup-and-delivery.”
        
    - Create a Google Business Profile and link it to your site.
        
- FAQ Content
    
    - Expand “/FAQ” with questions customers might search (e.g., “How long do ice cream cakes last?”).
        
    - Use schema markup for FAQ rich results.
        
- User-Generated Content
    
    - Encourage reviews on “/products” or “/ice-cream-cake” pages (stored in Supabase) to add fresh, keyword-rich content.
        

1. Off-Page SEO

This boosts your site’s authority and visibility beyond your pages.

- Backlink Building
    
    - Reach out to local food blogs or influencers for reviews linking to “/products” or “/blog.”
        
    - List your site in relevant directories (e.g., Yelp, local business listings).
        
- Social Media Integration
    
    - Add share buttons to “/blog” and “/products” pages (easy with Next.js components).
        
    - Promote new products or posts on X, linking back to your site.
        
- Google Business Profile
    
    - Claim and optimize it with your address, hours, and links to “/home” or “/location.”
        
    - Encourage customer reviews here.
        
- Monitor Brand Mentions
    
    - Use tools like Google Alerts to find unlinked mentions and request backlinks.
        

1. Tracking and Maintenance

SEO is ongoing—track and tweak regularly.

- Set Up Analytics
    
    - Install Google Analytics and Google Search Console (via Next.js scripts or Vercel integration).
        
    - Monitor traffic, rankings, and click-through rates.
        
- Keyword Performance
    
    - Check keyword rankings monthly (e.g., with SEMrush or Ahrefs).
        
    - Adjust content if rankings drop.
        
- Crawl Audits
    
    - Run quarterly audits with tools like Screaming Frog to catch broken links or crawl issues.
        
- Content Refresh
    
    - Update “/blog” and product pages every 6–12 months to keep them relevant (e.g., new flavors, seasonal promotions).

Priority Steps to Start

1. Keyword Research: Nail down your top 10–20 keywords.
    
2. Titles & Meta: Optimize “/home,” “/products,” and “/ice-cream-cake” first.
    
3. Technical Setup: Set up sitemap, robots.txt, and HTTPS.
    
4. Content: Write keyword-rich product descriptions and one blog post.
    
5. Analytics: Get Google tools running to track progress.
    

Tailored Notes

- Next.js Advantage: Use SSG for static pages (e.g., “/home,” “/FAQ”) and ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) for dynamic pages (e.g., “/products”) to balance speed and freshness.
    
- Supabase: Store product data and blog posts here—fetch them efficiently with Next.js API routes for SEO-friendly rendering.
    
- Niche Focus: Lean into your ice cream cake angle—terms like “custom ice cream cakes” or “birthday ice cream cakes” could be goldmines.
