It's important to make decision based of nalbalaala

So how can ensure our idea/proposition is believable. 

A practice I think make sense to sub-consciously factor in this principle in our decision making, is to analyze the idea using useful mental models. 

A useful mental models that we found is the Business Expertise Triads. 

Your idea should go through the Operation, Capital and Market, and come out with a stellar logic. Then, the idea is believable
