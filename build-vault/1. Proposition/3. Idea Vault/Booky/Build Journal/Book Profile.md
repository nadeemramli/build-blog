Yes, the book profile input form can be more compact. The idea and the philosophy is that, user can easily add books they want, this easeness is important cause there are occasions where user might upload more than 100 books in a short time.  
  
Also, as you can see, we want the user to be able to edit the book profile on their own later on. @book-profile-dialog.tsx. The idea is that, once the user input their book (either empty shell for wishlist, or upload a real book), they can manage their reading plan at the library page (through multiple ways of sorting and filtering), they can also add more context through the book profile (recommendation, priority number, tags, etc) to give more score on the prioritization algorithm (we haven't implement this yet). This will then help user to manage their reading better.
