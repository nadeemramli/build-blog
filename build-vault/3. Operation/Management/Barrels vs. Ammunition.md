There’s a framework we come back to constantly at Clarify when hiring, especially early on, when every hiring decision is critical to the future of the organization. It’s called “Barrels and Ammunition,” coined by Keith Rabois. In short:  
  
(1) Barrels are people who own outcomes. You give them a problem, and they figure out how to solve it, rallying teams, building the plan, shipping the result. They’re force multipliers.  
  
(2) Ammunition are task-driven executors. They can hit the target, but they need a direction, a plan, and someone to aim the cannon.  
  
You can have all the Ammunition in the world, but if you only have five Barrels, your company can only drive five key initiatives at once. Add another Barrel, and your org’s surface area for impact increases.  
  
We’ve seen this play out firsthand with our team.  
  
[](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelmollick/)[Michael M.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAdUwrMBxVJptOHlAssiuUEx_xboK6rALfE), one of our earliest engineering hires, is a Barrel.  
  
Mike has singlehandedly built our 3rd party gmail and microsoft connector, and our entire enrichment waterfall engine, and now, his pod is working out our email and sequencing capabilities.  
  
There isn’t a technical challenge in the world that Mike can’t solve with enough time.  
  
That’s what Barrels do: they turn ambiguity into outcomes and they raise the bar for everyone else around them.  
  
Here’s the takeaways:  
  
(1) You need both Barrels and Ammunition  
  
(2) Not enough Barrels? You can’t multi-thread  
  
(3) Not enough Ammunition? You can’t execute  
  
And sometimes, the Barrels you need are already inside your company, they just haven’t been pointed at the right problem yet.  
  
The best teams know how to identify, develop, and aim their Barrels.  
  
You can build a company with Ammunition.  
  
But if you want to build a company that can scale fast, you need Barrels.
