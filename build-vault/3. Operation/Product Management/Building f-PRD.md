# Problem Alignment¬†

|   |
|---|
|Describe the problem we are trying to solve in 1-2 sentences. I should be able to read this alone and communicate the value/risks to someone else.<br><br>- Why does this matter to our customers and business?<br>    <br>- What evidence or insights do you have to support this?|

  
  

## High Level Approach

|   |
|---|
|Describe the rough shape of how we might tackle the problem. I should be able to squint my eyes and see the same shape. For example, if the problem was ‚Äúdiscoverability of new features‚Äù, then this might be ‚Äúa notification center for relevant features‚Äù.|

  
  

## Narrative

|   |
|---|
|Optional: Share (hypothetical) stories to paint a picture of what life looks like for customers today. Describe common and edgy use cases to consider when designing the solution.|

  
  

## Goals

1. Describe high-level goals, ideally in priority order and not too many.
    
2. Include measurable (metrics) and immeasurable (feelings) goals
    
3. Keep it short and sweet
    

  

## Non-goals

4. List explicit areas we do not plan to address
    
5. Explain why they are not goals
    
6. These are as important and clarifying as the goals
    

  

|   |
|---|
|üõë¬† Do not continue if all contributors are not aligned on the problem.¬†<br><br>  <br><br>üü¢¬† Complete the following table with ‚Äúsignatures‚Äù from all reviewers to move on.|

# Solution Alignment¬†

|   |   |
|---|---|
|‚úÖ¬† Draw the perimeter|üö´¬† Do not force others to identify scope|
|||

  

## Key Features

Plan of record

7. List the features that shape the solution
    
8. Ideally in priority order
    
9. Think of this like drawing the perimeter of the solution space
    
10. Draw the boundaries so the team can focus on how to fill it in
    
11. Link out to sub-docs for more detail for particularly large projects
    
12. Challenge the size to see if a smaller component can be shipped independently
    

  

Future considerations

13. Optionally list features you are saving for later
    
14. These might inform how you build now
    

  

## Key Flows

|   |
|---|
|Show what the end-to-end experience will be for customers. This could be written prose, a flow diagram, screenshots, or design explorations. It will vary by project and team. Do not try to do this in isolation. Work with design and engineering to complete.¬†<br><br>  <br><br>It is natural for this section to become more specific over time. It might start as a few annotated screenshots or stories. It might become highly detailed requirements with acceptance criteria. Adjust to the way your team operates. If you have a strong designer who enjoys going into every edge case, lean on them. If you have detailed engineers who prefer to have each scenario documented, go deep on acceptance criteria.¬†<br><br>  <br><br>This will naturally change over time ‚Äî¬†that‚Äôs okay. When changes occur, document them in the [Changelog](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mEMDcHmtQ6twzNlpvF-9maNlAcezpWDtCnyIqWkODZs/edit#heading=h.n2tmu89lqb7n) and notify all contributors.|

  
  
  
  

## Key Logic

15. List rules to guide design and development
    
16. Address common scenarios and edge cases
    
17. It is often easier to write these out than rely on design to show every permutation

# Launch Plan

|   |
|---|
|Define the various phases that will get this product to market, the purpose of each phase, and the criteria you must meet to move on to the next one. Highlight risks and dependencies that can throw a wrench in timelines or progress (and ideally contingency plans). There is a table of example phases below.|

  
  
  

## Key Milestones

  

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|TARGET DATE|MILESTONE|DESCRIPTION|EXIT CRITERIA|

## Remember - THE GOAL IS ONE PAGE. Keep Cutting Until You Get There.

## Abstract

For this section, you‚Äôll need to sit and write about what you are trying to achieve, who is it for, what is it for, who is affected by the work, what success looks like, the history of the team, etc. This section is where you‚Äôll spend most of your time. However, it‚Äôs the key to understanding what you are spending all of this effort to build.

  

This is the paragraph that outlines the work, and it needs to be short. Someone should be able to read it and repeat it. When writing the abstract, one technique to consider is the [protostrategy method](https://uxdesign.cc/your-strategy-is-too-sacred-b4b85f6b8eee?gi=b58c96377c48) from Chris Butler ‚Äî build a five-page outline, then cut that down to one page, and eventually, to a single paragraph. After completing the other four sections, you‚Äôll come back to the abstract and finalize it.¬†

## Objectives

How does this initiative tie into the overall product strategy? Your project should have a direct line to the company‚Äôs objectives and goals.¬†

  

To get started, you‚Äôll need to reread the company‚Äôs product mission/vision/strategy docs and relate your project to these overarching themes. Do not try to force a connection between your abstract and the company objectives. This should serve as a check to see if this is worth doing. And if it isn‚Äôt, you should stop here and make your case as to why this is a waste of time.

## Resources

How are we going to staff this? Who is going to do what?

  

You want to collect all of this information in one easy-to-share place. You don‚Äôt want any surprises when the actual work gets going. Begin by looking at what (and who) is available and start talking to the folks involved to make sure they have an understanding of what‚Äôs at stake and what you need to get it done. Also - make sure you are clear about who needs to make decisions, and who needs to stay aware. However, remember it is their resources that you are going to need ‚Äî they can say no.

## Success/Survival

What does success look like? What about failure?¬†

  

To start determining the answers to these questions, look at the abstract, and start pulling the numbers. Make sure you add qualitative constraints as well, what are the third rails of this project? Think about survival, failure, and success, and explain it in terms anyone can understand. Describe exactly when to pull the plug [think about the resources you are using], keep going[what are some near term signs of success], or double down [success metrics].¬†

  

## Time Horizon

How long will this take? Even better - when can people expect answers? Leadership will want to know how you are going to use the resources available to complete your project when they should check-in and on what timeline.

  

If you are at an ‚ÄúAgile‚Äù shop - start with an estimate of how many sprints the work will take. Try to remember Parkinson‚Äôs Law (things take as much time as you let them) and balance it with the Law of Slack (we never finish things on time.) You are never going to nail this, but an estimate will help folks make a ‚Äúgo, no-go‚Äù decision.¬†

  
  
  

## A few notes...

- Meeting notes and retrospective notes are great to add as the project goes on. This can function as a complete log of the project.
    
- It‚Äôs fine if different disciplines take copies of this doc and use it for their own purposes, remember this is an alignment document. If teams are taking it back and using it, it‚Äôs a good thing!
    
- This document is alive. Take it with you to your meetings. Lead with it. When people are sick of talking about it, you are about halfway there.

Project Name - 1 Pager

September 04, 20XX by Steve Morin

  

If you like this template, join my newsletter, ProductiveGrowth, for more on Leadership, Management, Productivity, and Growth: [https://productivegrowth.substack.com/](https://productivegrowth.substack.com/)

Template Purpose

You should use this 1-Pager Project Brief template for an introduction to a new project. It‚Äôs used to introduce people to why a project is being pursued and what it is about, including context, how it‚Äôs being measured, strategy for implementation, and initial design/features if they exist.

---

# Project Introduction

Answer the question of what you will be working on:

- Author: <name>
    

- A summary of the project.
    

- This should be one paragraph at maximum.
    

- Designs (Optional if they exist)
    

- Milestone 1: <px link>
    
- Milestone 2: <px link>
    

# Vision / Why

1 sentence description of why you‚Äôre pursuing this project.

# Context:

Provide background information about the project. Answering questions like ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs broken?‚Äù or problems encountered. For example, the context for an onboarding experience project might be that ongoing issues and complaints make it hard for the user to onboard, so this is important to help users onboard.

# Objectives (What) / Key Results (How to measure)

## Objective:

- What are we trying to accomplish?
    

### Key result(s):

- What is a specific time-bound measurement to indicate success?
    

# Strategy / How

## Name of the first strategy

- How to implement the first strategy.¬† Details about what will and won‚Äôt be done for this strategy.
    

## Goals

- Operational Success Metric
    

- A measurable number to determine if the project or feature of the project is succeeding.
    

- Counter Metrics
    

- A measurable number to determine if things aren‚Äôt regressing.¬† So, even if a feature or project doesn‚Äôt increase a metric, it shouldn‚Äôt cause it to go down either.¬† For example, adding a feature shouldn‚Äôt cause signups to go down, revenue to drop, or churn to go up.
    

# Assumptions & Risks

## Platforms

- Web
    
- iOS
    
- Android
