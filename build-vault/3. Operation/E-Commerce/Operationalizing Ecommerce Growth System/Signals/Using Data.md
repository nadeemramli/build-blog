Understanding what data tell us

Data is simply an abstraction layer of recorded reality that is happening around us.

In using data, 



Data helps these parts work together and eventually create a momentum of good decision and good execution.

If you’re looking to validate, be data-driven. If you’re looking to innovate, be data-informed. If you are looking to find inspiration for an idea, be data-inspired.

| **Core Idea**      | Data is an input for a human decider.               | Data is the decider.                             | Data is a catalyst for vision and innovation.                 |
| **Key Question**   | Why did it happen and what should we do?            | What happened?                                   | What could be possible? What is best for the future?          |
| **Motives**        | If you’re looking to innovate                       | If you’re looking to validate                    | If you’re looking to innovate                                 |
| **Focus**          | **Information → Knowledge → Understanding**         | **Data → Information**                           | **Understanding → Wisdom**                                    |
| **Human Role**     | Interpreter of data within context.                 | Implementer of data's conclusion.                | Visionary who uses data to create new narratives.             |
| **Primary Output** | A considered decision.                              | An automated or prescribed action.               | A new hypothesis, a strategic vision, a story.                |
| **Weakness**       | Can be slower, still reliant on existing knowledge. | Brittle, lacks common sense, past-focused.       | Higher risk, requires creativity and tolerance for ambiguity. |

- **Core Idea:** Data is a crucial input, but not the _only_ input. The decision is made by a human who interprets the data within a broader context.
    
- **Connection to DIKW:** This approach operates heavily in the **Knowledge** and **Understanding** stages. You take the information ("What happened?") and apply your domain knowledge, experience, and context to understand _how_ it happened and begin to explore _why_.
    
    - _Example:_ The A/B test shows the green button won (Information). A data-informed product manager looks at this and combines it with their expertise (Knowledge). They might say, "This makes sense. Our recent user surveys indicated a desire for a 'fresher' look. The green color aligns with that feedback. The victory isn't random; it's because it fits our brand's new direction. Let's not only implement the green button here but also test this 'fresh' color palette on our checkout page."

- **Human-centric:** The data serves the human decision-maker; the human doesn't blindly serve the data.
    
- **Contextual:** It uses common sense, domain knowledge, and qualitative insights to interpret the numbers.
    
- **Critical Thinking:** As the table highlights, you critically evaluate if past data can be extrapolated to the future.




- **Core Idea:** As the table says, "Decision based only on the data that you have captured." The data itself dictates the action.
    
- **Connection to DIKW:** This approach primarily lives in the **Data** and **Information** stages. You collect data, process it into information ("What happened?"), and then a pre-defined rule triggers a decision.
    
    - _Example:_ An A/B test shows that a green button (Variant B) has a 0.5% higher click-through rate than a blue button (Variant A). A purely data-driven decision is: "The data says B is better. Implement B. No further questions."

**Lacks Context:** As the table notes, it can "lack common sense." It doesn't ask _why_ Variant B won or if this will hold true next week. It only knows _what_ happened in the past.



- **Core Idea:** Data is used not just to optimize the present but to envision and create the future. It's a catalyst for innovation and new hypotheses.
    
- **Connection to DIKW:** This approach is rooted in **Understanding** and aims for **Wisdom**. It uses a deep understanding of the "Why" to make judgments about "What is best" for the future.
    
    - _Example:_ An analytics team notices a correlation: users who use Feature X are 50% less likely to cancel their subscription (Information). A data-informed team might try to push more users to Feature X. A **data-inspired** team asks a bigger question: "_Why_ is Feature X so powerful? What fundamental user need does it solve?" (Understanding). Through this inquiry, they realize the core need is "a feeling of creative accomplishment." This insight doesn't just lead to optimizing Feature X; it inspires a whole new product strategy built around "empowering user creativity." They build a narrative and a vision (storytelling) based on this deep-seated need, which was sparked by a data point.
        
- **Characteristics:**
    
    - **Visionary:** It's about imagining possibilities that the data itself doesn't explicitly point to.
        
    - **Hypothesis-driven:** It uses data to form new, bold hypotheses to test.
        
    - **Storytelling:** It weaves data points into a compelling narrative about the user and the future direction of the product or company.


In short, imagine a car as the analogy here, if driver is the strategist, the engine is the execution, breaks and pedals is the optimization, data is the gear that help everything went smooth. You might expect data is the fuel here, no capital/resource has always been the fuel. Driver had to choose better route, better path to achieve destination, using which gear will tell the engine the route, the engine won't know. Engine then decide to move based of it's co if it's fuel shows constraint, engine move

"There are many ways to get value out of data, but...  
there is only ONE path: Data -> Story -> Buy-In -> Action -> Value."  
  
While the flow proposed by Christian is straightforward, I believe it's yet oversimplified.  
  
In real life, this flow is transformed into a graph where:  
  
1️⃣ Core Sequential Path (Solid Blue):  
  
Data -> Story -> Buy-In -> Action -> Value remains the backbone.  
  
2️⃣ Critical Feedback Loops (Solid Orange):  
  
* Action -> Data: Actions taken generate new data, restarting/refining the cycle.  
  
* Buy-In <-> Story: Buy-in attempts reveal needed refinements to the story (and sometimes drive collection of new data). This is bidirectional and iterative.  
  
* Value --> Buy-In (Dotted Orange): Perceived or actual value strengthens buy-in for future initiatives (a reinforcing loop).  
  
3️⃣ Key Confounding/Influencing Factors (Green Dashed Lines):  
  
* Organizational Culture: Directly impacts the ease of gaining Buy-In and taking Action.  
  
* Resources (Budget, Time, Skills): Constrains Data collection/quality and the feasibility of Action.  
  
* Stakeholder Dynamics/Politics: Heavily influences Buy-In and the implementation of Action.  
  
* External Events: Can disrupt or invalidate Data, change the required Story, alter Buy-In priorities, or make planned Action impossible/irrelevant. These are often uncontrollable.  
  
4️⃣ The Story<->Buy-In Co-Creation (Purple):  
  
This highlights that crafting the story and securing buy-in are not strictly sequential but deeply intertwined. The story is tailored and refined through the process of seeking buy-in.
