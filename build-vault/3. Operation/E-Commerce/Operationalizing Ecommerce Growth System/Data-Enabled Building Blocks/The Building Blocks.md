What do we have to address here?

Component Level

Model: Compass
Model: Driver
Model: Vehicle

Axis-A : Implementation (Model/Knowledge <-> Praxis/Utilize)
Axis-B : Adoption (Robust <-> Fragile)
Axis-C : Utilization (Structure/Utility <-> Praxis/Utilize) 
Axis-D : Abstraction (Model/Knowledge <-> Structure/Utility)

This model helps you model out every points/knowledge hierarchy in data. 

So what can we build from here?

First, using the approach of reverse engineering, the goal here is to fill up the cylinder with liquids ([[Trial and Error Deep Dive|progress/payoff]]) where we build up to the max (achieving [[Antifragility via Robustness|robustness.]])
- Using the building blocks as model, we could "falsify" our goal/objective setting or development. Some create a simple one liner goal to describe their vision/goal, which isn't enough to encapsulate the whole idea of adopting data for success. While, some have vague interest or goal with using data such as achieve innovation, unfair advantage, and moats, but that wouldn't describe the state aswell. 
- A good process we can develop here is to create a blank template, which help us brainstorm the ideal max condition. The blank template can be:  With {{domain}} {{success}} {{ergodicity}}


Identifying what's the C-V-D.
