title: "Adding Frontmatter for better code understanding"

I want to add comments to each file to document it's purpose, context, and usage for developers and AI agents. Below is my proposed YAML frontmatter template, to be added as /* */ comment at the top of each .tsx file. Can you help me implement this for all .tsx files in my src/ directory? We also want to ensure it doesn't break the TypeScript compiler. Additionally, I want to add JSDoc comments to all exported functions and React components, documenting their purpose, parameters, return values, and side effects. Please suggest a process, provide an example for one .tsx file, and evaluate my prompt for clarity and completeness.
