Five-step engineering process 

1. **Make requirements less dumb**: Question requirements to ensure unnecessary work isn't added.
2. **Delete parts or processes**: Remove parts or steps that aren't necessary.
3. **Simplify or optimize**: Optimize the process after making sure it's necessary.
4. **Accelerate cycle time**: Speed up the production process.
5. **Automate**: Automate the process to make production more deterministic.
