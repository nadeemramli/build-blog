# Decision Log - Figuring out what to do

## The Decision

Today have been a lot of nothing. Been sleeping the whole day, cook great food, but then I felt "useless", I don't deserve to cook foods like that, when I'm sleeping the whole day. 

Tonight my decision is stay up late, and work on my understanding towards Metric Trees.


---------
## Context and Reasoning

We figured long time ago that a complete operating model require three parts framework:
1. Drivers
2. System
3. Execution

Within the system framework, there's what we called Value Architecture. This is what we need to learn more.


---------
## Expected Outcome

I'm expecting to see a playbook or a complete system (model, process, philosophy, artifacts).

The goal we're supposed to see, is that when there's any problem, or when there's new client onboarded that needed to figure out Value Architecture. I can work on it from early to finish.

## Actual Outcome

## Learning / Gap Analysis

_The key insight from the difference between expectation and reality_
